During “idea-creation,” low-contrast categories increase the likelihood that descendant inventions will combine the focal invention with more (a) boundary-spanning, (b) novel, (c) original, and (d) atypical knowledge inputs. During “idea-positioning,” they allow greater leeway in articulating how descendant inventions depart from the focal invention’s lineage and chart new technological directions. We find robust support for our hypothesis using data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s classification system spanning nearly four decades. Further analyses demonstrate that the catalyzing effect of low-contrast categories has important material consequences: inventions classified in low-contrast categories spur descendant inventions that generate substantially higher economic value and exert more enduring technological impact than those in high-contrast categories. By introducing the concept of catalyzing categories, this study offers a novel theoretical perspective on the genesis of groundbreaking inventions and the role of categorical structures in the inventive process.",ok

One reason for this is that the conflict that arises in intercultural creative collaboration is a double-edged sword, and so how it is managed matters. In this research, we examine how the gender of collaborating dyads influences the link between intercultural conflict (task and relationship) and creative collaboration effectiveness. Through two studies (a laboratory study and a field survey), we found that intercultural task conflict has a negative effect on creative collaboration in men dyads but a positive effect on creative collaboration in women dyads. Conversely, intercultural relationship conflict has a negative impact on creative collaboration in general, but this effect is stronger for women dyads than for men dyads. These effects can be traced to how men versus women dyads handled intercultural conflict. There is also evidence that information elaboration (exchange, discussion, and integration of task-relevant information and ideas) mediates the effects of dyad gender and intercultural conflict on creative collaboration. These findings extend current understanding of when and how intercultural collaborations can result in creativity benefits from a gender and conflict management perspective.",ok

In college admissions and workplace hiring contexts, we find that decision-makers are more likely to favor disadvantaged applicants over applicants with objectively higher achievements when choosing between selection policies than choosing between individual applicants. We document this policy–people gap among admissions officers, working professionals, and lay people using both within-subject and between-subject designs and across a range of stimuli. We find that the gap is driven in part by shifting standards of fairness across the two types of decisions. When choosing between individuals, compared to choosing between policies, decision-makers are more likely to prioritize what is fair to individuals (a microjustice standard of fairness) over what is fair in the aggregate (a macrojustice standard of fairness). As a result, an intervention that has decision-makers prioritize the same standard of fairness across the decisions mitigates the policy–people gap. This research helps us understand why decision-makers’ choices so frequently violate espoused organizational policies and suggests one way to increase the representation of disadvantaged groups in organizations.",ok

Improved communication technology has facilitated the use of bridge supervision, so manager and boss can easily interact by audio or onscreen as a pair of people disconnected from surrounding colleagues—but at what cost to the manager, or to effective management? We argue that bridge supervision affects the way in which managers play their role, but not how well the role is played. We find clear support for the argument in a traditional corporate hierarchy. Managers operating under bridge supervision exclude the boss from their work discussions and are conservative in expressing emotion. Behavioral correlates notwithstanding, compensation and good ideas have their familiar association with network brokerage independent of bridge versus embedded supervision. In sum, bridge supervision affects manager style, but not performance. We conclude this paper by discussing the implications of our findings for future research.",ok

In contrast to previous audience-centered explanations, our phenomenological theory emphasizes how brokers construe (i.e., perceive and interpret) their networks. We contend that when women perceive themselves as brokers in friendship networks they experience threat, rooted in negative stereotypes about women brokers, which undermines their performance. Using data from a cohort of MBA students, Study 1 finds that women (but not men) exhibit lower performance when they perceive themselves as brokers in small-group friendship networks. Using data from a larger group of MBA students, Study 2 replicates this finding and rules out the possibility that underlying differences in the propensity to connect those whom one bridges may explain the observed gender-based difference in broker performance. Using an experimental design, Study 3 finds that elevated anxiety about task performance and negative social evaluations mediate the relationship between brokerage and performance for women but not for men. Women and men differ in how they psychologically construe brokerage in friendship networks, and this difference helps to account for gender differences in the performance of network brokers.",ok

Building on theory regarding uncertainty in exchange, we propose that potential exchange partners pay more attention to a firm’s capability reputation than its character reputation in the wake of adverse events. Thus, capability reputation has a buffering effect on relationship formation. In contrast, current exchange partners attend more to the firm’s character reputation than its capability reputation following adverse events. Hence, they are less likely to dissolve their relationships with organizations with high character reputations. Furthermore, we propose that the buffering effects of capability reputation and character reputation will be significantly reduced when the adverse events are caused by factors within the firm’s control. We find support for our arguments in an analysis of interstate gas transmission pipeline accidents in the United States from 2004 to 2013.",ok

Further, given that the process underlying the relationship between subordinate deviance and abusive supervision may be explained by social exchange theory, we examine the differential strength of supervisor self-regulation impairment versus social exchange as mediating mechanisms. We also explore the moderating effects of subordinate performance and supervisor bottom-line mentality (i.e., a one-dimensional frame of mind that revolves around securing bottom-line outcomes to the neglect of competing priorities) on the relationship between subordinate deviance and supervisor self-regulation impairment. We found that supervisor self-regulation impairment mediated the relationship between subordinate deviance and abusive supervision, and the indirect effect was stronger in the presence of high subordinate performance and high supervisor bottom-line mentality. We then replicated these findings in a longitudinal field study across four time periods, and demonstrated that self-regulation impairment provides a stronger explanation for the relationship between subordinate deviance and abusive supervision than social exchange.

Models of identity construction have suggested that a past career decision—choosing one professional “road” while leaving behind a “road not taken”—should lose its salience over time. We challenged that consensus by introducing the construct of forgone identity dwelling—thinking about and reflecting on a professional path that could have been. Our field and experimental studies showed that employees did dwell on forgone professional identities, even when the decision events that resulted in them were years in the past. Drawing on cognitive-motivational-relational theory, we showed that forgone identity dwelling resulted in longing—a yearning for something missing. Such longing created a “double-edged sword” for the behavioral consequences of forgone identity dwelling. On the one hand, longing was associated with increased withdrawal behavior and decreased helping behavior because employees were distracted from the here and now. On the other hand, longing was associated with job crafting that in turn reduced those reactions—particularly for employees with an internal locus of control. We discuss the implications of our work for models of identity construction.",ok

Little is known, however, about how single or repeated third party employment branding occurrences relate to key human capital outcomes. Extending signaling theory by considering signal credibility and comparability, we use archival and survey data from 624 BPTW participants in 16 competitions across a three-year period to develop and test hypotheses linking BPTW certifications to collective turnover rates and key informant perceptions of applicant pool quality. We find that certifications are associated with lower turnover rates, and in addition, propose competing crystallization and celebrity hypotheses that model turnover trajectories with repeated certifications, finding diminishing marginal turnover reductions across multiple certifications. We also examine company size and industry job opening moderators, finding that as certifications increase, applicant pool quality is: (1) higher in smaller companies, and (2) higher when job openings are scarcer. Finally, beyond being certified or not, we find supplemental evidence for effects of the specific certification level achieved (e.g., 2nd versus 15th). This investigation advances theory related to collective turnover, applicant pool quality, and employment branding, and is relevant to company decisions about seeking or re-seeking third party certifications.",ok

Consequentially, firms face social pressures to adopt responsibilities that have traditionally fallen to governments, aid agencies, and other types of organizations. There are questions, though, about whether this is beneficial for society. We study this in the context of disaster relief and recovery, in which companies account for a growing share of aid, as compared to traditional providers. Drawing on the dynamic capabilities literature, we argue that firms are more able than other types of organizations to sense areas of need following a disaster, seize response opportunities, and reconfigure resources for fast, effective relief efforts. As such, we predict that, while traditional aid providers remain important for disaster recovery, relief will arrive faster and nations will recover more fully when locally active firms account for a larger share of disaster aid. We test our predictions with a proprietary data set comprising information on every natural disaster and reported aid donation worldwide from 2003 to 2013. Using a novel, quasi-experimental technique known as the “synthetic control method,” our analysis shows that nations benefit greatly from corporate involvement when disaster strikes.",ok

We extend this literature by integrating behavioral concepts on attribution and learning from failure that highlight the differences in behavioral responses to success versus failure. We theorize that serial entrepreneurs whose previous venture failed are likely to blame the external environment and change industries for their subsequent venture, and that this industry change is costly in that it invalidates potentially useful industry experience, thereby hindering their subsequent venture. In contrast, founders of failed ventures are unlikely to change aspects of their previous business (when starting their subsequent venture) that would be attributable to their leadership—that is, strategy, decision-making, and planning style. Using data on entrepreneurs in China and the U.S., we find support for our theory. The results have important implications for the study of serial entrepreneurship, and more broadly for research on behavioral responses to failure.",ok

By conducting a qualitative study of emergency-department physicians and their interactions with other hospital specialists, we show how specialists maintain professional values through two distinct processes of institutional work in which moral emotions—that is, emotions linked to the interests of others—play a key role. The first process is activated when a perceived episodic problem, which arises from value conflicts in interactions between different specialists, elicits transitory moral emotions that motivate institutional maintenance work through individual action. The second process is activated when a perceived systemic problem, which arises from conflict between professional values writ large and organizational practices, elicits moral emotions that are enduring and shared across specialists. These emotions mobilize collective action in institutional maintenance work that changes the organizational practice. By focusing on values as a source of conflict and a motive for professional action inside organizations, our model contributes a nuanced understanding to the everyday work of professionals and specialists and draws attention to emotion elicitors and emotional scope as affective mechanisms in processes of institutional work.",ok

In contrast, the potential for coercive isomorphism—which is a response to direct coercion rather than uncertainty—to spread through board interlocks remains unknown. Drawing on the forced compliance literature from social psychology, we propose that coercive isomorphism exhibits a ripple effect, whereby conforming to coercive pressures leads directors to internalize their acquiescence and apply it to the other boards on which they sit. We test this relationship in the context of nonprofit interlocks on the boards of 209 publicly traded U.S. firms between 2010 and 2014, predicting that coercive pressure to minimize overhead in the nonprofit sphere—a phenomenon known as the nonprofit starvation cycle—spreads to corporate boards through nonprofit interlocks, leading the corporate boards to reduce firm investment in intangible assets. We find that this relationship manifests across our sample, but is strongest via interlocks held by powerful directors and in industries characterized by high investment in intangible assets. Finally, we also find that the coercive isomorphism ripple effect ultimately decreases firm value.",ok

As language is both a skill and a source of identity, low-status language speakers may experience identity-based exclusion in such organizations, regardless of their common corporate language skills. We thus explore how linguistic inclusiveness can emerge among tensions between the demands for multilingual services and the need for a lingua franca in organizations. Grounded in a qualitative study of a Russophone bank in Kazakhstan, we theorize how actors with different linguistic and sociocultural backgrounds engage in sociolinguistic work—that is, everyday actions that shape practices surrounding the use of a particular tongue within an organization—in the context of changing linguistic dynamics in society. Through sociolinguistic work, members of marginalized, in-between, and dominant groups respond to societal changes and influence others’ perceptions of languages and behaviors, ultimately reshaping internal linguistic dynamics over time. By conceptualizing language as an important dimension of diversity, theorizing the emergence of linguistic inclusiveness through sociolinguistic work, and highlighting the critical role of an in-between group in this process, we advance research at the intersection of languages and inclusiveness in organizations.",ok

However, individuals capitalize in the context of workplace relationships that serve instrumental functions, pointing to the possibility that the process of capitalization may at times be instrumental as well. In this paper, we integrate theory on capitalization with the social-functionalist model of emotions to develop a model that explains how workplace interpersonal capitalization serves the instrumental function of spurring knowledge sharing. We identify pride as a linking mechanism between workplace interpersonal capitalization and knowledge sharing, and we argue that experiencing pride is contingent on employees disclosing positive events that they attribute to their own efforts. We also identify perceived coworker responsiveness as a boundary condition qualifying the association between pride and knowledge sharing. A source- and time-separated field study and an experience sampling field experiment with a daily intervention provide support for our hypothesized model. Overall, our work broadens the concept of capitalization and contributes to the social-functionalist model of emotions.",ok

We demonstrate that these feelings of pride and anxiety have diverging effects on voicers’ tendency to withdraw from social interaction during the rest of the day. In turn, these diverging effects on voicers’ interpersonal avoidance influence voicers’ daily interpersonal citizenship behaviors. We further propose that recipients of voice have the potential to “hijack” voicers’ affective appraisals in a manner that can amplify or attenuate their emotional reactions and subsequent social behavior. Our results disentangle the complex experience of speaking up and provide novel insights into how voicers and organizations can maximize the benefits of voice while minimizing its harmful social side effects.",ok

Using longitudinal data on professional hockey teams, we examine the enforcer—a player who specializes in the prohibited activity of fighting. We find that team performance is more disrupted by the injury of an enforcer than by the injury of occupants of other formal roles on the team. In addition, team performance recovers more slowly after this setback to the extent the team tries to replace an enforcer, and the performance disruptions associated with his exit are magnified as a function of his experience with his team. We use these findings to develop new theory about organizational roles that operate outside official channels and formal structures. We suggest that such role occupants are more difficult to replace than their formal counterparts, in part because to enact these roles effectively requires experience in the local social context.",ok

Drawing on regulatory focus theory, I argue that work moralization can lead to prevention-focused cognitions (i.e., moral rumination), which impair and redirect the cognitive resources needed for creativity. However, I also posit that work moralization can lead to promotion-focused cognitions (i.e., cognitive flexibility), leading employees to adopt cognitive approaches that increase creativity. Moreover, integrating research on value congruence, I suggest that work moralizers are the least likely to ruminate—and the most likely to become cognitively flexible—when they perceive that their values are aligned with those of their organization, which ultimately fosters higher levels of creativity. I test my theoretical model with two field studies and a preregistered experiment.

In Study 1, we use qualitative data to identify five ways employees communicate with their partner in order to engage in individual initiative OCB (e.g., staying late at work, volunteering for special assignments). In Study 2, using dual-concern theory, we hypothesize that self-concerned citizenship communication strategies will not only increase OCB, but also increase work–family conflict, and we predict that other-concerned communication strategies will reduce work–family conflict and increase partner satisfaction. Using survey data from employees and their partners, these hypotheses were partially supported. Finally, in Study 3, we use experimental vignette methodology to provide causal evidence that citizenship communication strategies influence partner satisfaction. Together, these studies increase our understanding of how employees communicate with their partner about OCB, indicate that there is no single communication strategy that has positive implications for both OCB and home life, and suggest that employees and their partners tend to think of OCB as involuntary for achieving family goals.",ok

The fairness literature offers unclear predictions about the extent to which observers would judge allocations that fail (vs. attempt) to account for such structural barriers as fair. We suggest that past conceptual discussions and empirical designs did not factor in the causal ambiguity embedded in information about structural barriers and the variance in how individuals interpret such information. Hence, we propose that beliefs in the causes of success, anchored in the endorsement of meritocratic ideals, shape fairness judgments by determining the weight given to performance indicators and structural barriers. Such effects emerge in the presence of information about structural barriers in the context of the decision, a feature that is absent from past studies. We discuss our theory and findings in the context of calls for bridging organizational fairness and social justice research and for a nuanced understanding of people’s responses to violations of the meritocratic ideal within organizations.",ok

Status inconsistency refers to the extent to which social actors occupy status positions accorded different amounts of social esteem and prestige in different social systems. Status inconsistency affects the performance of multi-unit organizations by weakening the well-established positive effects of status on performance because it creates status ambiguity that makes external evaluations of the organization and its individual units more difficult. Distinguishing between high-status and low-status multi-unit organizations, we argue further that status inconsistency is particularly problematic for high-status multi-unit organizations, whereas low-status multi-unit organizations may actually benefit from status inconsistency. We test our arguments using a longitudinal sample comprised of 109 international business schools and their finance, accounting, marketing, management, and operations departments from 2002 to 2013.

We integrate the social distance theory of power with consent-based theories of power to posit that, although psychological power elicits negative behaviors and perceptions, these same reactions hurt leaders’ subsequent well-being. To explore this possibility, we conducted an experimental experience sampling study with a sample of managerial employees whom we surveyed for 10 consecutive workdays. We find that leaders enact more abusive behavior and perceive more incivility from others on days when they are exposed to psychological power compared to days when they are not. Leaders higher in agreeableness are less affected by psychological power. In turn, abusive behavior and perceived incivility harm leaders’ subsequent well-being as indicated by their reduced need fulfillment and ability to relax at home. We discuss theoretical implications for research on psychological power, abusive leadership, perceived incivility, and leader well-being, as well as practical implications for employees and their organizations.",ok

Our process model of practice preservation highlights that a declining practice may persist across generations if it is made more accessible and resilient by reducing its dependence on specific types of meanings, materials, and competences that risk being lost. Our analysis suggests that these outcomes depend on the work of two types of custodians—legacy professionals and new enthusiasts—in terms of “diversifying” the practice to accommodate multiple configurations of meanings, materials, and competences, thus constituting new practice variants, as well as supporting the continued enactment of variants over time by engaging in processes we label “propping up,” “recovering,” “replenishing,” and “releasing.” In addition to developing a rich understanding of preservation, our findings contribute to a nuanced perspective on practice evolution by conceptualizing a practice as comprising multiple, potentially fluid variants. Moreover, by highlighting inclusive custodianship processes, which differ from gatekeeping and guarding so far emphasized, and by unpacking the role of materials to complement the traditional emphasis on symbolic elements, our findings enrich the nascent custodianship literature.",ok

In this study, we examine audiences’ responses to the interdimensional incongruence between capability and integrity signals, particularly by focusing on how the salience of positive capability signals aggravates investor reactions to organizational misconduct, a negative integrity signal. Using irregular financial restatements as the negative integrity signals and prior alliance announcements as the positive capability signals, we find that investors react more negatively to restatements by firms whose alliance announcements are more salient—that is, the firms that announce more frequently and firms that create more positive expectations from those announcements. We also find that firm size and level of diversification weaken these negative effects.

Few have captured the interactional dynamics between the two. This oversight tends to obscure how an extant collective action frame may shift or how a new one may arise during such interactions. To address this issue, we focus on movement–target interactions and illuminate the microfoundations of framing that produce a new collective action frame. Drawing on real-time participant observations, we examine how an unintended collective action frame emerged and escalated during a year-long interaction between the Occupy London movement and St. Paul’s Cathedral, Church of England. Occupy protesters shifted from a “capitalism is crisis” frame targeting the U.K.’s financial establishment to a “what would Jesus do?” frame targeting the Church of England. We develop a process model based on the interplay of frame laminations and three situational mechanisms—emotional attachment to a frame, frame sacralization, and frame amplification—derived from an analysis of framing in movement–target interactions to explain the emergence and escalation of an unexpected collective action frame.",ok

We examine this first in the context of U.S. corporate boards, where firms face pressure to increase gender diversity. Analyses of S&P 1500 boards reveal that significantly more boards include exactly two women (the descriptive social norm) than would be expected by chance. This overrepresentation of two-women boards—a phenomenon we call “twokenism”—is more pronounced among more visible companies, consistent with our theorizing around impression management and scrutiny. Experimental data corroborate these findings and provide support for our theoretical mechanism: decision makers are discontinuously less likely to add a woman to a board once it includes two women (the social norm), and decision makers’ likelihood of adding a woman or minority to a group is influenced by the descriptive social norms and scrutiny faced. Together, these findings provide a new perspective on the persistent underrepresentation of women and minorities in organizations.",ok

We argue that positions of structural power induce organizational identification, which motivates a view that one’s workplace is equitable. Seven archival studies of government employees (Studies 1a–1 g) and three surveys of working adults (Studies 2a, 2b, and 3) suggest those higher in structural power perceive less inequity in their workplace due to higher organizational identification, resulting in lower support for diversity initiatives. Asking managers to deliberate on inequities within their own organization, thus challenging their default positive view, helps managers overcome their identification barrier (Study 4). This research helps shift the foci of resistance toward diversity initiatives from demographics or ideology to one’s managerial position and provides practical implications for organizations seeking to support their diversity initiatives.",ok

We conduct a longitudinal, inductive study of Ontario’s cool-climate wineries and members of six external audience groups who evangelized on behalf of their emerging winemaking practice. We found that wineries drew from three institutionalized vinicultural templates—“provenance,” “hedonic,” and “glory”—to craft rituals designed to convert these audience members. These rituals led to inspiring emotional experiences among audience members with receptive gourmand and regional identities, driving them to engage in evangelistic behaviors. While a growing body of work on evangelists has emphasized their individual characteristics, the role of emotions in driving their activities, as well as how they advocate for organizations, our study demonstrates how evangelism can be built through ritualized interactions with organizations. Specifically, we reveal how organizations develop rituals that translate emerging practices into inspiring emotional experiences for particular members of audiences. This suggests that rituals can be used not only to incite dedication within organizational boundaries, but to inspire members of external audiences to act as social conduits through which emerging practices spread.",ok

Drawing on an inductive, qualitative analysis of interviews with ARO advocates, as well as textual and visual archival data collected from AROs’ websites, we argue that the suppression of emotion plays a critical role in AROs’ disruptive work. We find that advocates are motivated to suppress their emotions by a perceived incompatibility between their reactive emotional displays and their affective commitment to institutional work, or what we label reactive–affective conflict. We show how two triggers of reactive–affective conflict—potential supporters’ investment in the status quo and emotive norms governing institutional work—encourage ARO advocates to suppress their emotions in face-to-face interactions with audiences while attempting to elicit emotions via visuals as their strategy of disruptive work. We contribute to the literature on the strategic use of emotion in institutional work by highlighting important relationships between the characteristics of potential supporters, the nature of institutional work, and institutional workers’ management of their own emotions to further their institutional projects. In doing so, we add needed nuance to extant conceptualizations of how emotion is strategically deployed as part of purposeful efforts to create, maintain, and disrupt institutions.",ok

We found that the change in physician professional role identity required significant identity work by a group of actors, but particularly by the managers who had been charged with leading the reform initiative.

We engage in an in-depth qualitative study of 49 founders in Taiwan that reveals how founders’ identity structures can be (mis)aligned with their perceived social structures, and how the reinforcement or tensions generated by (mis)alignment can fuel the creation of fundamentally different types of ventures—including those that challenge the perceived sociocultural status quo with a social mission intended to push society toward a new equilibrium. Our theory of founder identity–society (mis)alignment is therefore able to specify a key mechanism linking the founder’s identity with perceived sociocultural context. Furthermore, we advance the influential Schumpeterian theory of creative destruction beyond the purely economic context to address the broader sociocultural environment and to incorporate the concept of creative reconstruction, in which entrepreneurs seek to restore elements of society past.",ok

The study builds on the assumption that individuals in knowledge-intensive workplaces employ dissonant ties to access distinct work-related benefits, and establishes a link between dissonant ties and performance. Subsequently, it provides an in-depth analysis of employees’ willingness to rely on this potentially unpleasant but instrumental networking behavior, and suggests that formal hierarchical rank, tenure, and unit membership, as critical elements of the organizational architecture, drive dissonant tie formation. In the empirical analysis, the study utilizes survey and interview data collected from engineers in a large manufacturing firm. The findings confirm that seeking problem-solving assistance from difficult colleagues entails performance benefits. Moreover, the embeddedness of individuals in the organizational architecture shapes the employment of dissonant ties. Dissonant ties are, hence, context driven. By simultaneously addressing the consequences and the drivers of employees’ networking behavior, the study presents a comprehensive theory of dissonant ties that challenges and refines previous research on the interplay between positive and negative networks.",ok

In some cases, founders’ identities adjust as they experience periods of pragmatic deference, contestation, and domination by an in-group that moves increasingly toward identity homophily.

We argue that this debate remains unresolved because we lack a holistic understanding of how each human capital type influences performance when founding conditions vary, and aim to reconcile the contrasting claims by considering how “hard” a crisis hits a given industry. Analyzing data collected from 500 founders who created firms in Greece during the Great Recession, combined with data from the Greek Statistical Office, we find that general human capital provides the greatest benefits, on average, during a crisis; yet specific human capital is more valuable in both the most favorable and the most unfavorable industry contexts.

To better understand the processes underlying integrative negotiations in East Asian cultures, we introduce two constructs to the theory. “Trust radius” refers to the width of the social circle within which people are willing to trust and cooperate. “Harmony concern” refers to the intention to cultivate and maintain a harmonious relationship that avoids conflict and discord with others. In four studies—a survey (Study 2), two experiments (Studies 3a and 3b), and a simulation (Study 4)—we show that trust radius, which tends to be wider in Western than in non-Western cultures, moderates the relationship between trust level and information exchange. We also find that harmony concern, rather than trust level, directly predicts information exchange in East Asian cultures but not in Western cultures.

In a sample of 1,253 employees from 54 work units, we investigate the effects of differences in disability status between supervisors and subordinates on leader–member exchange (LMX) quality and subsequent performance ratings, and find that incongruence in general is related to lower LMX quality and lower performance. In addition, we propose and find an asymmetrical effect of disability incongruence, such that LMX quality is worse in dyads in which the supervisor has a disability than in dyads in which the subordinate has a disability. Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of unit-level climate for inclusion on this relationship and find support for a buffering effect of inclusive climates on the negative incongruence-LMX relationship for scenarios in which the supervisor, but not the subordinate, has a disability. We build relevant theory for the relational demography, disability, LMX, and organizational climate literatures by predicting these effects on the basis of status mechanisms. These findings have important practical implications, as they provide companies with a feasible way to manage their diverse workforce.",ok

We consider the interplay of women’s social networks (ties to family, to community, and to men in power), information and communication technology (ICT) use, and time in relating to the initiation and success of women’s entrepreneurial ventures. Results from a seven-year field quasi-experiment in 20 rural villages in India support the model. Ties to family and community positively, and to men in power negatively, relate to ICT use, entrepreneurial activity, and entrepreneurial profit. ICT intervention also strongly impacts entrepreneurship, with 160 new businesses in the 10 intervention villages compared to 40 in the controls. Results also demonstrate the dynamic interplay of social networks and ICT use. For ties to family and community, the amplification effect is such that the highest levels of entrepreneurial activity and success are observed among women with high centrality and ICT use—effects that increase over time. For ties to men in power, ICT use is associated with increased entrepreneurial activity only when these ties are low, but these interactive temporary temporal patterns do not emerge for profit. We address implications for the grand challenges of empowering women in less developed countries.",ok

Prior research has explained this puzzling phenomenon predominantly through an “actor-centric” perspective, proposing that managers’ just behavior is an outcome of their own individual differences. This paper shifts the locus of theorizing away from managers to their organizational context by arguing that managers’ adherence to principles of justice is often influenced by two key contextual features—workload and rewards. Drawing on the multiple-task pursuit framework, we propose that under high workloads, just treatment of employees often competes with other managerial tasks. We further argue that organizations implicitly and explicitly signal to managers that acting justly is not as important as their other technical tasks. Hence, managers who face high workloads (i.e., high amounts of work and time pressures) tend to prioritize other technical responsibilities at the expense of acting justly, unless explicitly rewarded otherwise. We find support for our theorizing across three studies (an experience sampling study, a field study, and an experiment). We discuss the implications of our theory and findings for future research on managerial fairness and offer novel practical implications for organizations attempting to ensure employee fair treatment.",ok

Drawing on emotions as social information theory, we suggest the effects of leaders’ expressions of anger depend on both the type of violation about which anger is expressed and the type of leader who expresses it. We test this in a series of studies using experimental and field methods. Study 1 shows that a leader’s anger expression in response to followers’ integrity-based violations enhances observers’ perceptions of leader effectiveness, whereas anger in response to followers’ competence-based violations diminishes observers’ perceptions of leader effectiveness. Study 2 shows that these divergent effects occur because anger in response to integrity-based violations elicits beneficial inferential reactions among followers who observed the anger, whereas anger in response to competence-based violations provokes harmful affective reactions. Study 3 demonstrates that the negative effects of anger expressed toward competence-based violations are exacerbated, and positive effects of anger expressed toward integrity-based violations weakened, when a leader is perceived as abusive. These findings help reconcile divergent perspectives on the effects of leader anger expression, suggesting that anger can enhance perceived leader effectiveness when expressed in the right situation and by the right person.",ok

Instead, we find that workplace help-seeking and help-giving can be intertwined behaviors enacted through an organizational routine. Our research, therefore, shifts the theoretical emphasis from one of exchange and cost to one of joint engagement. More specifically, we move beyond the initial point of consent to recast help-seeking and help-giving as an interdependent process in which both the help-seeker and the help-giver use cognitive and emotional moves to engage others and thereby propel a helping routine forward. In contrast to the existing literature, an organizational routines perspective also reveals that helping need not be limited to dyads, and that the helping routine is shaped by the work context in which help is sought. Finally, we extend these insights to the literatures on routines and coordination and debate how our results might generalize even if helping is not part of an organizational routine.",ok

We address this topic by linking institutional logics with the theory of organizational coalitions and power to predict how such choices are affected both by external influence (through ownership) and by internal influence (through shared decision making). In particular, we analyze how the old state socialism logic and the new market capitalism logic competed to influence Chinese firms’ mergers and acquisitions (M&As). We find that these institutional logics affected M&A decisions via the coalitions committed to each logic—coalitions whose balance of power reflected the external power source of ownership and the internal power source of board representation. We also find that each coalition’s strength changed as the market capitalism logic became more established during China’s economic transition, and that investors viewed M&As by firms with high state ownership skeptically.",ok

By conjuring visual snapshots of the future, leaders paint a portrait of what their organizations can one day achieve. It would thus stand to reason that leaders who naturally think and speak in terms of picture-like detail (a “concrete orientation”) would promote more organizational change than those who are inclined to think vaguely (an “abstract orientation”). Yet, research has established that individuals with a concrete orientation tend to focus on short-term, narrow details (e.g., small features of a single product) rather than long-term visions requiring the coordinated effort of all employees. To determine how and when concrete-thinking leaders induce large-scale change, we integrate theory on attention, organizational hierarchy, and construal. We predict that leaders who have a concrete orientation will promote change by redirecting their attention toward long-term visions of the future, if their organizations have strong, rather than weak, hierarchies. By contrast, hierarchical strength will have no such effect on leaders with an abstract orientation. We test these predictions in an archival study of CEOs and then examine the attention-based process that helps explain this effect in a preregistered experiment.",ok

Contrary to what we would have believed from the extant literature, we found that the most profound change did not emerge in practices that witnessed the greatest increase in the quantity of resources or in which change agents were given the highest degree of control. Instead, change emerged in a practice that was not treated as a priority and that subsequently attracted interest from a very limited number of individuals. Our findings contribute to the resourcing literature by showing that the ability to use resources is shaped by how they are valued and distributed, and that strategic change initiatives can act as triggers for resource revaluations and redistributions. Specifically, we demonstrate that strategic change initiatives may contribute to the emergence of favorable conditions for change in practices that do not become associated with valued resources. This is because a lack of valued resources attracts limited interest from stakeholders, thereby allowing changes to emerge as powerful agents face minimal coordination costs and scrutiny when attempting to align arrangements with their own interests. Our study thereby shows how and why change initiatives can trigger divergent developments across multiple practices and lead to change emergence in unexpected places. It also highlights the role of what we call “resourcing space” in contributing to emergent change.",ok

Introducing the theoretical perspective of ecological rationality, we challenge this view and argue that, under conditions of uncertainty common to managerial decision making, managers can actually make better decisions using fast-and-frugal heuristics. Within the context of personnel selection, we show that a heuristic called Δ-inference can more accurately predict which of two job applicants would perform better in the future than can logistic regression, a prototypical rational strategy. Using data from 236 applicants at an airline company, we demonstrate, in Study 1, that, despite searching less than half of the cues, Δ-inference leads to more accurate selection decisions than logistic regression. After this existence proof, we examine, in Study 2, the ecological conditions under which the heuristic predicts more accurately than logistic regression using 1,728 simulated task environments. Finally, in Study 3, we show in an experiment that participants adapted their strategies to the characteristics of a task—and increasingly so the greater their previous experience in selection decisions. The aim of this article is to propose ecological rationality as an alternative to current views about the nature of heuristics in managerial decisions.",ok

This, in turn, creates a team emergent state focused on progressively striving toward achieving the team’s highest potential (collective promotion focus), which ultimately enhances team performance. We test our model across three studies wherein we manipulate leader humility to test the social contagion hypothesis (Study 1), examine the impact of humility on team processes and performance in a longitudinal team simulation (Study 2), and test the full model in a multistage field study in a health services context (Study 3). Our findings collectively support our theoretical model, demonstrating that leader behavior can spread via social contagion to followers, producing an emergent state that ultimately affects team performance. We contribute to the leadership literature by suggesting the need for leaders to lead by example and showing how a specific set of leader behaviors influence team performance, providing a template for future leadership research on a wide variety of leader behaviors.",ok

Alternatively, attributional theories of leadership suggest that evaluations depend on knowledge of past organizational performance, which is attributed to the leader’s skills. We develop a novel theory showing how inferential and attributional processes simultaneously explain top-level leader evaluation, and, ultimately, leader retention and selection. We argue that observers will mostly rely on attributional mechanisms when performance signals clearly indicate good or poor performance outcomes. However, under conditions of attributional ambiguity (i.e., when performance signals are unclear), observers will mostly rely on inferential processes. In Study 1, we tested our theory in an unconventional context—U.S. presidential elections—and found that the two processes, due to the leader’s charisma and country’s economic performance, interact in predicting whether a leader is selected. Using a business context and an experimental design, in Study 2, we showed that CEO charisma and firm performance interact in predicting leader retention, confirming the results we found in Study 1.

We make such a theoretical contribution within the domain of strategic alliances by investigating the effects of previous alliance agreements, or prior ties, between the partnering firms. We find that prior ties generally lead to learning about a partner’s anticipated behavioral patterns, which helps a firm predict when self-interested behavior may occur and know how to interact with the partner during the coordination and execution of the alliance tasks. By contrast, the kind of trust emphasized in social exchange theory is not generally rooted in prior ties and only emerges from prior relationships under certain conditions.

Drawing on the emotions as social information (EASI) framework (Van Kleef, 2009), we develop a conceptual model in which display intensity and display authenticity differentially influence customer loyalty by changing customers’ affective reactions and cognitive appraisals. Further, we propose that the relative impact of either dimension depends on customers’ motivation to understand the environment deeply and accurately (i.e., their epistemic motivation). We tested our model in one field study and one laboratory study. Results across these two studies provide consistent support for the proposed model and advance our understanding about how different dimensions of employees’ positive affective displays enhance customer reactions.

In Study 1, a longitudinal field study of customer service representatives (n = 763) who simultaneously identify with multiple brands they represent to customers, we examine the relationships between identity conflict and enhancement, on the one hand, and objective sales performance, on the other. We find independent effects for identity conflict and enhancement on intrinsic motivation, perspective-taking and performance, such that identity conflict negatively and enhancement positively affects all three variables above and beyond average identification. Intrinsic motivation further mediates the relationships between identity conflict and enhancement on sales in a direction consistent with our theorizing. However, while significant, perspective-taking does not mediate these relationships in the expected direction, because it has a negative effect on sales.

The current study proposes another important but neglected antecedent of cultures: a leader’s past cultural experience. Specifically, we theorize that group leaders enact cultures based on their past cultural experiences, essentially transferring cultures from their former groups to their current groups. Two studies, one in the field (Study 1) and another in the laboratory (Study 2), reveal that the levels of cultural tightness in current groups are predicted by group leaders’ past experience with cultural tightness in their former groups in which they were followers. This relationship becomes stronger when the group leaders identified with or had longer tenure in their former groups. In addition, the cultural tightness that leaders transferred from their former groups to their current groups influences negative (counterproductive work behavior) and positive (promotive and prohibitive voice) forms of group deviance.

We propose that female leaders are less likely than male leaders to capitalize on these benefits of delegating. Although delegation has communal (e.g., relational) and agentic (e.g., assertive) properties, we argue that female leaders, as compared to male leaders, find it more difficult to delegate tasks due to gender-role incongruence. In five studies, we draw upon social role and backlash theories to show that women imbue delegation with more agentic traits, have more negative associations with delegating, and feel greater guilt about delegating than men. These associations result in women delegating less than men and, when they do delegate, having lower-quality interactions with subordinates. We further show that reframing delegation as communal attenuates women’s negative associations with delegation. These findings reveal that even when a given behavior has both agentic and communal elements, perceptions of agency can undermine women’s engagement in them. However, emphasizing the communal nature of seemingly agentic acts may encourage women’s engagement in such critical leadership behaviors.

Building on research in this vein, we develop a dynamic theory of information-based competition that suggests the rating discounts a firm receives from rating agencies owned by its rivals’ investors are shaped by the reputational threats and opportunities faced by the firm and its rivals, which motivate and enable investors to use information intermediaries to intervene in competitive dynamics.

We address this shortcoming while also advancing knowledge on each type of fit. We offer a more nuanced examination of vertical fit (which has typically been assessed with respect to organizations’ broad strategic types) by focusing on the alignment of an HPWS with an organization’s market entry timing mode—a key element of strategy. We propose that among organizations pursuing new product development, the effect of an HPWS on organizational performance is most positive under a fast-follower entry timing, followed by a first-mover and finally a fence-sitter entry timing. We then hypothesize that the benefit of vertical fit is magnified when the complementary human resources practices comprising an HPWS are implemented with greater internal consistency (or with similar intensities) across the ability, motivation, and opportunity domains—reflecting a positive interaction between vertical and horizontal fit in predicting the effectiveness of an HPWS. Analyses of four-wave nationally representative panel data yield strong support for our dual-alignment model of SHRM.",ok

This study focuses on theoretical and empirical distinctions between the different potential organizational reactions to failure (in this case around new product development) and how those feedback-driven choices aggregate to affect firm performance. To understand when and why negative feedback is organizationally beneficial, we focus on how possession of domain-specific experience affects the way in which firms interpret and respond to negative feedback, offering both organization- and mechanism-level theories. In particular, we distinguish between conditions that should lead to different behavioral responses to negative feedback: retreat, local search, or distant search. We find support for our theory using data on all U.S. mutual fund companies from 1962 to 2002, and testing both aggregated and mechanism-level theories. Our results show that negative feedback on new funds launched in new domains is particularly damaging to subsequent organizational performance, as firms retreat from the unknown in favor of already exploited domains. In contrast, negative feedback in experienced domains can produce positive outcomes by encouraging action to search for both local solutions to correct the problem and distant solutions to expand the firm’s opportunities.",ok

Because knowledge work is often accomplished through the flow or sequential progression of work across multiple occupations, knowledge claims must be legitimized and accepted across those occupations and not by just a single focal user group. Yet, we know little about the deeper changes that organizations must make regarding who has the legitimate expertise to produce knowledge claims and what counts as valuable knowledge when the algorithmic mode of knowledge work enters the workplace. To explore this, we draw on workplace jurisdictions as the foundation for dividing and coordinating work among occupations to study how the algorithmic mode of knowledge work becomes integrated with the situated flow of work, creating a new workplace jurisdiction. Our three-year ethnographic study of the radiology workflow in a medical center shows that interlacing practices weave together the two distinct modes of knowledge work by reorganizing existing relations among tasks, workplace artifacts, and technologies and enacting those reorganized relations. Contrary to the literature’s focus on the interface between algorithmic knowledge claims and a single focal user group, our study proposes a trans-group focus that refines scholarly understanding of how organizations can integrate algorithmic technologies with situated practices of professionals and their knowledge claims, as well as how new workplace jurisdictions emerge around technologies.",ok

In this research, we theorize that, while women actively respond to anticipated sexism using social identity–based impression-management (SIM) strategies (e.g., attempting to appear less feminine in cover letters), these actions can actually backfire because they clash with prescriptive gender stereotypes. Across three studies, we investigate the motivations, techniques, and outcomes of managing gender in job applications for different kinds of jobs. We find that women, but not men, manage gender when applying for gender-incongruent (i.e., male-dominated) jobs by using less feminine language, and that, paradoxically, they are less likely to be hired when they do so. The current research contributes to our understanding of the consequences of SIM strategies and shows that women’s coping behavior in response to existing gender inequalities in the labor market is a novel and ironic mechanism through which occupational gender-segregation is perpetuated.",ok

We introduce the construct of contingent-diversity rhetoric, which emphasizes that diversity is beneficial if its challenges are overcome, and thus captures the reality of diversity’s effects. Drawing from the psychology of the self, we theorize that leaders use contingent-diversity rhetoric less commonly than value-in-diversity rhetoric, due to fear of appearing prejudiced. Drawing from the psychology of employee motivation, we theorize that contingent-diversity rhetoric results in more diversity effort among employees than value-in-diversity rhetoric does because contingent rhetoric increases perceptions that diversity goals are difficult to achieve. Four multimethod studies support the proposed descriptive–prescriptive paradox: contingent-diversity rhetoric is descriptively less common, but prescriptively more effective, than value-in-diversity rhetoric. Our research advances theory on fostering diversity and inclusion in organizations and suggests that leaders can increase employees’ diversity effort by changing the way they talk about diversity.",ok

Integrating the signal set congruence and incongruence literature with role theory, we theorize three-way interactive effects among diversity practices (resource, non-discrimination, and accountability) on women and racialized non-leader and leader turnover. We examine our model with two studies. In Study 1 (longitudinal panel data from 2010 to 2018; n = 270–280 law firms), we find higher levels of resource practices decreased turnover rates when both safeguarding practices (non-discrimination and accountability) were high and congruent. Further, resource practices are less useful in reducing non-leaders’ turnover rate when safeguarding practices were mixed, whereas they are less useful in curbing leaders’ turnover rate when accountability practices were low. We theorize different underlying mechanisms for non-leaders and leaders at the individual level of analysis, finding initial support in an experimental vignette study (Study 2, n = 650 non-managers and 661 managers). The relationships between the three-way interaction and non-leaders’ and leaders’ turnover intentions were mediated by concerns about unfair treatment and personal relevance, respectively.

Leader-triggered positive emotion and subsequent social exchange, operationalized as leader–member exchange (LMX), functioned as key sequential mechanisms mediating the relationship between LH and subordinate OCBs. LH induced positive emotion in subordinates, which fostered high-quality LMX and, in turn, OCBs. Contrary to expectations, the stress relief explanation of LH was not supported. This research contributes to knowledge of humor in organizations, and particularly LH, as it is the first to establish a link between LH and OCBs and also represents the first integration and concurrent examination of three functions of humor. We additionally offer empirical contributions to the humor literature by providing a comprehensive test of prior conceptual arguments regarding mechanisms of LH and validating a measure of LH that can be used in future research.

We further propose that autonomous occupations pay better than prosocial occupations. Across two distinct nationally representative samples in the United States, we find that people with upper-class (vs. lower-class) parents are more likely to work in autonomous occupations, but less likely to work in prosocial occupations, even when controlling for education, occupational prestige, and other potential confounds.

We examine portfolio spillover by extending the awareness–motivation–capability framework from its traditional domain of competitive dynamics to the governance arena. We theorize that firms will be more likely to respond to investors targeting other portfolio members to the extent that those firms become aware of the implicit threat of activism. We also develop and test theory about how the capability of activists to launch a successful campaign and the motivation of firms to react can moderate this relationship. Using data from a sample of S&P 1500 companies from 2000–2013, we find that firms restructure and reduce growth in response to portfolio spillover.

Our results provide compelling evidence that investor perceptions of M&A announcements are not only configurational in nature but also characterized by equifinality (or the presence of multiple paths to success) and asymmetric causality (i.e., configurations that represent bad deals are not simply a mirror image of good deals, but differ fundamentally). By constructing a typology of “good” and “bad” deals as perceived by market participants, we develop a mid-range theory of M&A stock market performance. As such, this study offers novel theoretical and empirical insights to scholars as well as implications for practitioners.",ok

In this study, we develop and test theory on how potential coalitions are built through shared experience and recruitment of allies. When organizations respond to performance relative to aspiration levels, either as problemistic search following low performance or opportunity exploration following high performance, members form coalitions to influence decisions. We develop theory of coalition formation that builds on upper echelons theory and the theory of dominant coalitions to predict how past experience of decision makers leads to preferred actions by each member and subsequent coalition formation. We use this theory to make new measures of potential coalitions and apply it to acquisitions made by firms in China. We find evidence that the experience of members of the key decision-making group—the board of directors—affects the potential coalition building, and hence the type of acquisition target, as predicted.",ok

This lessened interpretation results in fewer competitive entries by potential entrants.

Organizations commonly set targets—explicit and quantitative reference points—for their operational units that reflect top management aspirations for these units. Targets are commonly the outcome of a subjective process where supervisors combine their explicit and tacit knowledge to set performance expectations for their units. Using a proprietary database from a large European travel company during a period of rapid expansion, we document the effect of organizational learning by studying how targets change as units mature. In particular, we examine managers’ experiential learning from branches’ past performance and their vicarious learning from branches in the same region in determining performance expectations over the life cycle of branches. Our results indicate that, in setting performance targets, managers increase the weight of a branch’s past performance and decrease the weight of comparable branches’ performance as the branch matures. Vicarious learning, where managers extrapolate the performance of comparable branches to a new branch, dominates in the early years. Over time, this type of learning is replaced by experiential learning as experience accumulates. We document how early on in the life of branches, these two types of learning interact; this interaction disappears as branches mature. Furthermore, we find that managers learn differently from successes and failures early in the lives of the new units, and this learning is affected by the magnitude of the successes and failures.",ok

We develop the construct of “paradoxical leader behavior” in people management, which refers to seemingly competing, yet interrelated, behaviors to meet structural and follower demands simultaneously and over time. In Study 1, we develop a measure of paradoxical leader behavior in people management using five samples from China. Confirmatory factor analyses support a multidimensional measure of paradoxical leader behavior with five dimensions: (1) combining self-centeredness with other-centeredness; (2) maintaining both distance and closeness; (3) treating subordinates uniformly, while allowing individualization; (4) enforcing work requirements, while allowing flexibility; and (5) maintaining decision control, while allowing autonomy. In Study 2, we examine the antecedents and consequences of paradoxical leader behavior in people management with a field sample of 76 supervisors and 516 subordinates from 6 firms. We find that the extent to which supervisors engage in holistic thinking and have integrative complexity is positively related to their paradoxical behavior in managing people, which, in turn, is associated with increased proficiency, adaptivity, and proactivity among subordinates.",ok

Through a time-lagged field study of 672 employees and their 114 supervisors in two organizations, we find support that greater workplace loneliness is related to lower job performance; the mediators of this relationship are lonelier employees’ lower approachability and lesser affective commitment to their organizations. We also examine the moderating roles of the emotional cultures of companionate love and anger, as well as of the loneliness of other coworkers in the work group. Features of this affective affiliative context moderate some of the relationships between loneliness and the mediating variables; we also find support for the full moderated mediation model.

In contrast to general assumptions in the literature regarding the need to develop identity at the highest level of a system, we argue that within a multiteam system, identification with that system negatively relates to multiteam system performance, whereas identification with the component team positively relates to multiteam system performance. Our uncertainty perspective suggests that identification with the multiteam system introduces uncertainty regarding the appropriate norms and interdependencies in the system, which leads to more depletion, and consequently lower system performance. Conversely, identification with the component team offers less uncertainty, resulting in less depletion and higher multiteam system performance. Thus, our integrated theoretical framework suggests that depletion mediates the negative effects of multiteam system identification and the positive effects of component team identification on multiteam system performance. Moreover, consistent with our uncertainty perspective, the indirect effect of identification on multiteam system performance via depletion is stronger when task complexity is high and weaker when task complexity is low.",ok

Based on data from 1,298 non-state-owned Chinese listed firms for 2000–2017, we find that firms with Party-member board chairs file fewer patent applications and are more likely to commit patent infringement. These effects are weaker if a board chair is younger or has higher educational attainment. Importantly, the moderating effect of young age is reduced as the presence of older Party-member corporate directors in a region becomes more prominent. However, the moderating effect of education appears to be unaffected by the presence of older Party-member directors.

We argue that corporate proximity improves a business unit’s local search process through two mechanisms—vertical linkages and corporate attention—that positively condition the likelihood of persisting; that is, reentering a product market after having experienced a prior product failure in that market. We find support for our theory using data on reentry in the U.S. medical device industry following exit from the market due to product failure. We also explore how age of the product market and characteristics of the failure—cause and severity—further moderate corporate proximity’s role in business unit reentry.

This approach is notable because it suggests that different organizations with similar experiences may have quite distinct reactions based on where that experience originates.

Borrowing from paradox theory, we explain how hybrids can empower individuals to fluidly separate and integrate logics when neither structural compartmentalizing nor organizational blending is feasible because management cannot prescribe a specific balance of logics. Second, we explain the state of “elastic hybridity,” constituted through the recursive, multilevel relationship between polysemy and polyphony. Elastic hybrids maintain unity in diversity. They are capable of institutionally bending without organizationally breaking and thus enable individuals to practice more of their personal convictions at work while still experiencing a sense of shared organizational purpose. Third, we show how contested hybrids can be made to last.

Our empirical analysis of 46 firms from 1978 to 1997, operating within the U.S. medical device and pharmaceutical sectors, demonstrates that while decision makers initiate structural recombination during periods of industry growth (i.e., munificence), they reduce their recombination efforts during periods of industry turbulence (i.e., dynamism), and managerial turbulence (i.e., growth in top management team size). We also find evidence that firms delay realignment and bide their time for better environmental conditions of declining turbulence and industry growth before pursuing more structural realignment. Together, these findings suggest that decision makers often delay initiating structural recombination until they can effectively process information and assess how structural changes will help them realign the organization to the environment.",ok

We develop a process model of professional stigmatization that identifies the dynamics that precipitate and then catalyze that trajectory and highlight the underpinning mechanisms. By unpacking the complex process of stigmatization, the study extends existing understanding of how aspects of stigma emerge and are attached by different stakeholders to a profession and the consequences that follow.

Although current research has explained the phenomenon using several different theoretical perspectives, prior studies have not explicitly tested the theorized mechanisms. This paper develops and tests a model that incorporates three theories of trickle-down effects for interactional justice perceptions: social exchange theory, social learning theory, and displaced aggression. Using cross-sectional data from 200 supervisor–subordinate dyads in Study 1 and longitudinal data from 270 supervisor–subordinate dyads in Study 2, we test this multiple mediator model. The results demonstrate that the two aspects of interactional justice perceptions—interpersonal and informational justice perceptions—trickle down from supervisors to subordinates through two different mechanisms. Specifically, displaced aggression accounts for the trickle-down effects of interpersonal justice perceptions and social exchange accounts for the trickle-down effects of informational justice perceptions. We discuss the implications of the findings for research on trickle-down effects and organizational justice.",ok

These penalties should deter questionable behavior and enable reputation to serve a social control function, yet we know little about how and when these penalties are actually imposed. Unlike prior research in this vein, we account for the fact that reputational penalties associated with such practices may differ across audiences because of differences in interpretations of the practice and differences in causal attributions about its use. Specifically, we develop theory to explain how and when stock analysts and peer executives applied reputational penalties to managers when firms used a poison pill, a prominent anti-takeover device. We find that the reputational penalties associated with poison pills differed substantially between these two groups and that these groups applied different penalties depending on the media coverage that the poison pill received, the performance of the firm, and the extent to which the practice had already been adopted. The findings suggest that reputational penalties for questionable behaviors may be more contingent and harder to sustain than previously thought.",ok

We examine our extended firm-specific human capital theory in a context in which the classic firm-specific human capital dilemma likely exists: business academia. Using a unique data set of 4,164 business school professors from 39 of the top 100 U.S. business schools, we examine how research performance affects propensity to become an associate dean and their compensation increases when taking on these roles. Even though associate dean roles come with a significant pay increase, we find that higher-performing individuals are less likely to become associate deans.

Moreover, we integrate findings from cognitive psychology to argue that these contradictory effects increase the more a firm’s performance falls behind market expectations. Our hypotheses find support in an extensive analysis of 937 quarterly earnings calls in the U.S. pharmaceutical, hardware, and software industries, and of journalists’ statements and analysts’ earnings forecasts and recommendations. Our novel theorizing and findings suggest that the use of discursive frames, especially in the form of metaphorical communication, in firms’ interactions with critical audiences creates thought-provoking and thus-far neglected dilemmas.

First, we shift focus away from structural and relatively static organizational responses to institutional complexity and identify three balancing mechanisms—segmenting, bridging, and demarcating—that allow individuals to manage competing logics and their shifting salience within their everyday work. Second, we integrate these mechanisms in a theoretical model that explains how individuals can continually keep coexisting logics, and their tendencies to either blend or disconnect, in a state of dynamic tension that renders them conflicting-yet-complementary logics. Our model shows how actors are able to dynamically balance coexisting logics, maintaining the distinction between them while also exploiting the benefits of their interdependence. Third, in contrast to most studies of newly formed hybrids and/or novel complexity, our focus on a long-standing context of institutional complexity shows how institutional complexity can itself become institutionalized and routinely enacted within everyday practice.",ok

Because rivals are embedded in dyads, triads, tetrads, etc., a multilevel view can unearth awareness cues that specify a hostility profile and make the awareness construct prescient. Studying thousands of competitive encounters over 10 years, we show that, at the firm and dyad levels, diversification and asymmetric pressure (differential exposure to competitive pressure) are reliable cues predicting competitive encounters. At the network level, convergence drives triadic encounters (competition with a rival’s rival), and the degree of separation among indirect competitors defines the outer bounds of the hostility profile. Specifically, direct rivals and second- and third-degree indirect competitors merit awareness—more distal players do not. Together, the awareness cues and hostility profile delineate the conceptual bound within which awareness is prescient and beyond which it is misplaced. Challenging several assumptions, our study shows that an arena view assists in predicting cross-industry competition; applying firm, dyad, and network levels of analysis is advisable to better foresee competition; and indirect competitors are “profilable,” allowing us to “see” rivals even before they strike.",ok

In our sample of S&P 500 firms between 2010 and 2018, we find that competitors are more likely to attack the focal firm when the successor’s professional experience differs drastically from that of the predecessor and less likely to do so when the successor is an insider. We also find that competitors’ attacks following a succession event can be minimized by limiting changes to only one form of capital (i.e., human or social). Moreover, retaining the predecessor as board chair after the succession could be an effective human capital preservation strategy for reducing competitors’ attacks when the difference in professional experience between the predecessor and successor is high. However, retaining the predecessor as board chair may not have the same effect when it comes to social capital. Our research highlights the competitive implications of CEO succession, offering new insight into disruption.",ok

Priming independent self-construals did not enhance career-oriented proactive behavior, even when we manipulated job autonomy. In a field Study 2 (n = 205), we found that employees with interdependent self-construals working in jobs with high interdependence reported higher work unit commitment and higher work unit–oriented proactive behavior compared to employees in low interdependent jobs. Employees with independent self-construals working in jobs with high autonomy also exhibited stronger career commitment and more career-oriented proactive behavior than did those in jobs with low autonomy.

Interestingly, FBEs have no motive to slow down and doubt their own sensemaking, yet MTAs can induce them to do so. We unpack the social skills and tactics used by MTAs to accomplish this pacing.

The second premise is that those executives who do believe in the business case will readily invest in CSR-related activities. The results from our four studies tell a different story. We show that managers, rather than focusing on factual evidence, believe in the business case because they espouse a fair market ideology—the tendency to justify and idealize the market economy system. At the same time, even though managers espousing a fair market ideology believe in the business case for CSR, they are not more inclined to engage in CSR than managers who do not hold such an ideology, because they also experience weaker moral emotions when confronted with ethical problems. By drawing on system justification theory, we simultaneously explore antecedents and consequences of executives’ belief in the business case for CSR and of their moral emotions.

In so doing, I surface how emotions shape the way paradoxes are recognized and experienced. My model invites paradox scholars to consider the centrality of emotions in paradox navigation, thus moving beyond emotions as something to be avoided and instead embracing their generative potential.

We test these arguments through a three-part survey of 203 employees from 33 work teams of a telecommunication company in China.

Hence, the present investigation integrates dynamic logic, theory, and methodology from the discipline of developmental psychology—wherein the nature of the topic has necessitated a more careful examination of change over time—into the organizational literature. As a product of this integration, we propose and test a novel theoretical perspective that provides several contributions to teams research. First, we extend theory that has thus far been primarily used to explain intraindividual development in children to detail three testable principles of dynamism in team properties. Second, and utilizing a within-construct logic, we demonstrate that teams are indeed dynamic systems, but that the extent to which any particular team property may be considered dynamic is contingent upon characteristics of the property itself.

On one hand, diversity incentives may generate identity threat and concerns about backlash among women; on the other, they may be viewed as costly signals of organizational support for women’s leadership aspirations. A preregistered field experiment (n = 2,035) shows that communicating the existence of organizational diversity incentives increases women’s aspirations to lead by 11.3% relative to sharing a goal-free diversity statement and by 11.7% relative to communicating diversity goals alone.

Our findings have implications for pursuing change, as well as for managers seeking to create a constructive environment for expressing discontent.",ok

We test this prediction in four studies. First, using multi-rater evaluations of young managers, we find that self-reliance relates positively to leadership evaluations for women, but not for men. Next, in each of three experiments, we manipulate the gender of a leader and the agentic trait he or she displays (e.g., self-reliance, dominance, no discrete agentic trait). We find that self-reliant female leaders are evaluated as better leaders than self-reliant male leaders are. In contrast, we find a male advantage or no gender advantage for dominant leaders or leaders who are described positively, but not in terms of any discrete agentic trait. Consistent with expectancy violation theory, the female advantage in the relationship between self-reliance and leadership evaluations emerges because self-reliant female leaders are seen as similarly competent, but more communal, than self-reliant male leaders are. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the effects of self-reliance, gender stereotypes, and stereotype violations on leadership evaluations.",ok

In our qualitative analysis in a Latin American organization, we develop a model that documents the everyday dynamics of context collapse among gay male employees. In a disclosure dilemma, employees are uncertain about how to be a professional online and simultaneously keep SNSs as platforms where they can show more relaxed versions of themselves. As a response, most employees adopt mirroring, and attempt to reflect their face-to-face disclosure levels on SNSs. Some employees engage in destigmatization efforts online, and as an outlier case we mapped an employee in collapse denial. Our study questions the established idea of disclosure as a relatively controlled process in microinteractions. We also nuance the assumption of SNSs as safe spaces and show the unintended impacts of context collapse on the stigmatized.",ok

We posit that host country is a value-laden context wherein a foreign entity’s strategic action stimulates host country stakeholders’ social sentiments and engagement in systems of discourses (“sentiment arousal”), mobilizes social sentiments toward the foreign entity (“sentiment competence”), and legitimizes social sentiments and the strategic action of the foreign entity (“sentiment resonance”). To test our theory, we employ a context of inward acquisitions by emerging market firms in an advanced economy, and postulate that host country sentiments toward objects of the inward acquisition (deal, acquirer, and inward investments from home country) will influence the likelihood of deal completion, an indication of host country legitimacy. We further highlight the patterns of host country sentiment dynamics, and showcase how sentiment volatility, wavelength, and augmentation exert heterogeneous effects on deal completion. Overall, we advocate a theory of host country sentiments in international management research that elucidates the interplay among host country sentiments, systems of social discourses, and multinational enterprise strategic outcomes in a host country.",ok

Drawing from social psychology literature on stereotypes, we argue that two fundamental dimensions of social perception—warmth and competence—help explain the underlying processes and conditions under which CSR leads to specific outcomes. We propose that firms engaging in CSR are perceived as higher in warmth and, by default, competence; moreover, different perceptions of the organization’s warmth and competence can moderate CSR rewards and CSI penalties. To demonstrate this, we conduct three experiments. Experiment 1 links CSR with perceptions of warmth and competence, showing that warmth perceptions mediate the relationship between CSR and important outcomes, such as purchase intentions and reputation. Experiment 2 adds information on firms’ countries of origin, revealing that CSR rewards and CSI penalties differ depending on the (mis)alignment of CSR strategy with country stereotypes. Experiment 3 replicates these findings using behavioral paradigms. We find that firms from high-warmth countries (the United States, Sweden, Portugal) receive lower CSR rewards and pay higher CSI penalties than firms from low-warmth countries (Germany, Pakistan) but this effect is moderated by competence. Our micro–macro study advances social evaluation, strategic CSR, and international management literatures.",ok

Drawing on the firm–director interdependence perspective, we predict that director candidates’ social capital and human capital have inverted U-shaped effects on their likelihood of joining a declining firm. Moreover, the declining firm’s organizational social capital differently moderates the effects of candidates’ social capital and human capital. Evidence from a sample of public firms under special treatment (*ST) in China supports our theoretical predictions.",ok

The goal of our research is twofold: first, to organize the contradictory theories under a comprehensive theoretical framework, and, second, to resolve the inconsistency between negative feedback and recipient creativity. Across two studies—a quasi-field experiment and a laboratory experiment—we find that the direction of feedback flow determines the nature of the relationship between negative feedback and recipient creativity, via two distinct mechanisms: task processes and meta-processes. Negative feedback increases recipient creativity in the bottom-up feedback flow (from followers to supervisors), because it heightens the recipients’ focus on task processes, whereby the recipients focus on the generation of better task strategies to close the creativity–standard gap. In contrast, in the top-down (from supervisors to followers) or lateral (between peers) feedback flows, negative feedback heightens the recipients’ focus on meta-processes—a psychological state in which recipients feel threatened by negative feedback—and thus hinders recipient creativity.",ok

The endorsement of a practice in a subunit’s environment plays a particularly crucial role in the extent to which it is implemented, relative to authorization by the parent firm. Furthermore, subunits strongly rely on the active evaluation of the practice’s propriety, such that the consonance between the two propriety dimensions (strategic importance and value compatibility) is central to implementation increase, while dissonance between them can favor implementation decrease.

Using insights from organizational behavior research, we argue that horizontal coordination between component teams can benefit if a multiteam system is composed of generalist members who are acquainted with the multiple functions present in the overall system (i.e., high intrapersonal functional diversity [IFD]). At the same time, however, such IFD may have detrimental side effects because generalists’ broad focus may distract them from high-impact, specialized activities (i.e., aspirational behavior). Building on insights from organization theory, we propose that coordination across a multiteam system’s hierarchical layers (i.e., vertical coordinated action between a team tasked with system-wide integration and task-specialized component teams) is critical for reaping IFD’s benefits while avoiding its costs. These notions are supported in a sample of 236 14-person multiteam systems engaged in a realistic decision-making simulation. Our findings illustrate how combining insights from organizational behavior and organization theory can advance academic knowledge on multiteam systems and offer practical solutions for managing such systems.",ok

First, we draw on transaction cost economics to explain why and how the effects of cultural distance on the proportion of expatriate parent-country nationals form a curvilinear relationship, instead of a linear one as commonly proposed. Second, we integrate the values-based cultural distance concept with the norms-based tightness–looseness concept. This allows us to simultaneously account for cultural differences between countries and location-bound normative cultural effects within countries, which cannot be overcome solely through expatriate learning and adaptation. Using a large global dataset of Japanese MNEs, we find support for a convex relationship between cultural distance and the proportion of expatriate parent-country nationals. We also find a moderating (steepening) effect of tightness–looseness on this relationship. The results reconcile some of the tensions between the subjectivists’ values-based approach, which positions culture in the shared cognitions realm, and the structuralists’ approach, which places culture in a normative situational environment.",ok

We suggest that the impasse is partially due to prior research’s exclusive focus on how work orientation affects one’s effort and subsequent job performance. Drawing on theories of signaling, cognitive biases, and reciprocity, we propose that calling-oriented employees enjoy better objective career outcomes than job-oriented employees via an external pathway: managers misperceive employees’ calling orientation as evidence of better performance and stronger organizational commitment. In Study 1—analyses of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study—we find support for the main effect, and in Study 2—an online experiment—we constructively replicate this effect and find evidence for our predicted explanatory mechanisms. Furthermore, observing a calling-oriented employee prompts managers to perceive them more favorably in other domains, creating a halo effect.

Rather than leveraging their experience to bargain for maximum payments, highly experienced managers offer contractual payment structures that trade lower upfront payments for higher royalty payments in order to signal value. The signal instills confidence in the value of the partnership for skeptical licensee firms, and experienced licensing managers can amplify signals as needed to overcome the uncertainties inherent in technology commercialization. By explicitly addressing these variations in signal strength, we develop new theory that builds on classical signaling principles.

We test the hypothesized relationships in 42 teams that provided round-robin emergent leadership ratings and videotapes of their first, midterm, and final meetings. Team members’ verbal behaviors were captured using fine-grained empirical interaction coding. Multilevel modeling showed that task-oriented communication was a stable positive predictor of emergent leadership at all time points. Change-oriented communication predicted emergent leadership at the start of a project and diminished in relevance at the midterm and final meetings. Relations-oriented communication gained importance, such that an increase in relations-oriented behaviors toward the project end predicted emergent leadership.

We find that the intervention brought about relational changes by not only creating spaces where the team could experiment with new forms of interaction, but also by utilizing “interaction scripts”—concrete guidelines for interaction that specify content parameters and participation rules. We establish that the combination of spaces and interaction scripts was critical for helping the team enact counter-normative forms of interpersonal sharing that led to the emergence of positive relational dynamics. While existing research has highlighted the importance of spaces for enabling positive relational change, this paper theorizes the complementary role that interaction scripts can play in the change process.

In studying these processes, we develop the construct of “identity elasticity”—the tensions that simultaneously stretch, while holding together, social constructions of identity. To explicate the parameters of elasticity, we problematize previous conceptions of the three foundations of organizational identity—centrality, endurance, and distinctiveness—and document the dialectic tensions experienced in their social constructions. We show how identity is experienced not only through a listing of attributes but also by negotiating a set of processual tensions. In so doing, we also bring together two competing views on organizational identity—process and characteristic. We show how experiencing and navigating the tensions of elasticity is a type of organizational identity work (process) that changes organizational members’ constructions of identity (characteristic).

Using two multi-wave field samples of employees, we demonstrate the utility of approach–avoidance principles in conceptualizing workplace aggression constructs, as well as the processes and boundary conditions through which they uniquely influence outcomes. Implications for the workplace aggression literature are discussed.",ok

It is not surprising, therefore, that the prevailing assumption is that employees will react positively when their supervisors trust them more as opposed to less. Recent research, however, has suggested that the benefits of feeling trusted are accompanied by strains, which some employees may be unwilling to bear. Drawing on seminal theorizing on fairness, we propose that employees will perceive their supervisors as being more mindful of their needs—acting more fairly—when there is a fit between trust wanted and trust received, even when the fit is at low levels of trust. By extension, when trust received exceeds or falls short of an employee’s desire for trust, the employee should perceive the supervisor as less fair. We build a model in which the overall fairness perceptions resulting from the trust wanted–received interplay influence employee performance. Our model is supported by a multisource, three-wave field study and an experiment.",ok

Further, our investigation shows how ego depletion is proximally related to abusive supervision. In the first study, conducted at a Fortune 500 company and designed as a lagged survey study, we found that, after controlling for alternative theoretical mechanisms, supervisors who experienced FWC displayed more abusive behaviors toward subordinates, and that this relationship was stronger for female supervisors and for supervisors who operated in environments with greater situation control. These results were then replicated and expanded in an experience sampling study using a multi-organization sample of supervisors. This allowed us to study the FWC–abusive supervision relationship as it emerged on a day-to-day basis and to examine ego depletion as an explanatory mechanism. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that FWC was associated with abusive supervision, ego depletion acted as a mediator of the FWC–abusive supervision relationship, and that gender and situation control served as moderators.",ok

In the case of loneliness, we found that relational scripts formed the central theme of executives’ self-narratives, which informed how they acted and felt at work. Some executives drew on constraining scripts that portrayed self-isolating behavior as necessary for success. This led them to construct a deprived relational reality that rendered loneliness a persistent feature of their working selves. Our study reveals the process through which people changed this constraining self-narrative. For the executives we studied, it began when people crossed an emotional threshold, past which loneliness became intolerable. This prompted the insight that loneliness was partially an agentic construction, and drove experimentation with connecting scripts that, over time, replaced the constraining ones. As this occurred, people made deliberate efforts to construct more relationally enriching work realities and updated their other stories of self. Building on these findings, we develop a theory of continuity-breaking self-narrative change that reveals how people can create disjunctions between past and present selves.",ok

We refer to this tension as the paradox of promise. Through a qualitative study of former employees at the Eames Office, we examine how individuals navigate the paradox of promise as they construct retrospective career narratives. We find that individuals narrate their formative experience as imprints, but with two distinct emphases—values-dominant imprints versus skills-dominant imprints. Individuals then narrate their later career experiences by reprinting, reinforcing the existing meaning or finding new meaning in relation to their imprint; we induced three reprinting practices: (a) embracing values, (b) contrasting values, and (c) supplanting values. Using imprints and reprinting, former Eames employees crafted overarching sources of career meaningfulness: belongingness narratives, emphasizing collaboration and contribution with others; self-expression narratives, emphasizing authenticity and freedom; and achievement narratives, emphasizing expertise and accomplishment.

We take a person-centered theoretical approach to examine configurations of demands and resources that are sufficient to produce exhaustion, engagement, and other strain outcomes. Using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis across three studies, we find three equifinal configurations sufficient to produce exhaustion: (a) high workload and emotional demands, (b) low social support, and (c) high workload and low autonomy. We also find evidence for causal asymmetry in both exhaustion and engagement. Our person-centered approach yields more theoretically consistent results compared to a variable-centered approach.

We draw on findings from a comparative case study of Assertive Community Treatment teams to theorize about the identity work of groups and individuals that enables and constrains counter-institutional identity constructions. We develop a cross-level process model of encapsulation in which authoritative texts (or prescriptive documents) play a role in sanctioning and enhancing counter-institutional identities. The model shows how rigorous positioning against “who we are not” (an “identity foil”) through practices of oppositional identity work are combined with practices of relational identity work that reinforce counter-institutional identities by positively valuing “who we are” as superior to the foil.

Extending a key insight in signaling theory that positive and negative signals are conceptually distinct, we propose that which mechanism is dominant in explaining alliance formation varies between CSR and CSI. Specifically, we argue that the dominant signaling mechanism for CSR is the trust mechanism, through which CSR signals the moral character of a potential partner, which is used by the focal firm to infer the partner’s trustworthiness. In contrast, CSI negatively affects alliance formation primarily through a spillover mechanism: CSI signals a potential partner’s moral character to a firm’s external stakeholders. Stakeholders’ negative assessments based on this signal might then spill over to the focal firm if it forms an alliance with that partner. We further identify two contingency factors—namely, proximity and media coverage—that help verify the dominant signaling roles of partner CSR and CSI. Using a sample of alliances formed by high-tech firms between 1995 and 2016, we find support for our predictions.",ok

Prior research has focused primarily on pyramid-shaped formal hierarchies, despite documented limitations of the pyramid structure. We adopt a multi-method approach to consider the utility of alternative hierarchical shapes. First, we identify six “pure type” formal hierarchies that teams might employ. Next, we develop three propositions explaining the effects of hierarchy on team members’ cognition and behavior. We use the propositions to parameterize an agent-based computational model in which formal hierarchical differentiation influences team performance by creating power imbalances that affect team members’ perspective-taking motivation, and by influencing members’ social identification with the team. The modeling results reveal how the effects of the six hierarchies are contingent upon task characteristics that influence team members’ perspective-taking accuracy (e.g., task variety), and enable us to craft an expanded, team-level theory of the association between formal hierarchical differentiation and team performance. A field study of 68 clinical nursing shifts in five mid-sized hospitals supports a key theoretical prediction. Specifically, we find that a negatively skewed (inverse pyramid–shaped) formal hierarchy enhances team performance relatively to a positively skewed (pyramid-shaped) hierarchy when task variety is high, but not when task variety is low.",ok

In parallel, we analyze qualitative data obtained through interviews conducted during early months of the team-based empowerment initiative to identify common themes for why and how leaders facilitated or obstructed implementation. Leader identity work and leader delegation were identified as themes explaining (1) why higher-status leaders struggled with the new empowering role and (2) how specific leader actions either facilitated or inhibited sharing of tasks and leadership. Results suggest that team-based empowerment creates a status threat for high-status leaders who then struggle to protect their old identity as someone with distinct professional capabilities, which in turn leads to improper delegation behavior. Therefore, in order for team-based empowerment to succeed, leaders may need to change their perceptions of who they are before they will change what they do.",ok

We theorize that provisional spaces disseminate necessary information about an innovation and enable potential entrepreneurs to envision a new template for organizing. Therefore, geographic communities with a higher number of provisional spaces are more likely to host the first organization embodying a new form sooner than others. Using archival data on all movie-showing venues in Chicago communities, 1896–1927, we find empirical support for our theorizing. Community variance in volume and types of provisional spaces for movie projectors, such as opera houses and penny arcades, led to community-level differences in the emergence of distinct movie theater forms: nickelodeon, movie house, and movie palace. We advance scholarship on organizational form emergence by uncovering the role of provisional spaces in shaping localized opportunity structures.",ok

Our findings indicate that emotional control allows organizations to deal with contradictory logics and achieve their desired constellation, while unbidden emotions disrupt local efforts and enable changes in desired constellations of logics. Further, systemic power mediates the very experience of logics and the prospects of changing their constellation: Social asymmetry necessitates harder emotion work on behalf of the underprivileged, differentiating their experience of logics, and limiting the extent to which emotional eruption is a viable option. Thus, our study highlights the intersection of logics, emotions, and power, and how logics are managed and failed to be managed.",ok

We argue that the prevalence of past transgressions by high-status firms within the industry leads journalists to scrutinize the misconduct more, amplifying the effect of the focal firm’s status by highlighting its commonalities with past transgressors. Conversely, the prevalence of transgressions by high-status firms outside the industry attenuates the firm status effect on scandalization by directing media attention outside the industry, limiting the information that can be inferred from firm status. Past transgressors’ status and their categorical proximity to current transgressors serve as boundary conditions for the scandalizing effect of status. Our contribution lies in elucidating contextual factors that influence how status acts as an antecedent of scandals, and explaining how status and categories feed media routines that influence the likelihood of firm misconduct being scandalized.",ok

Although prior studies have investigated the roles of uncertainty and sunk costs as sources of inertia, an unacknowledged type of sunk cost associated with temporary suspensions of operations is related to the erosion of existing capabilities. Building on the resource-based view and real options theory, we argue that resource idling contributes to capability erosion and that the anticipated capability loss motivates firms to refrain from idling their resources under demand uncertainty in the first place. The negative effects of uncertainty on resource idling are likely to be particularly strong for firms with superior capabilities and for those having a greater reliance on human capital. Using data on oil drilling contractors in Texas, the empirical evidence lends support to our theoretical arguments. Our insights suggest that resource idling shapes the development path of capabilities and risks jeopardizing firms’ competitive advantages. The seemingly operational decision of temporarily idling resources can therefore be quite strategic for a firm, and “hysteresis,” or inertia in continuing operations, can preserve firms’ capabilities.",ok

We argue that withdrawals disrupt the relationships of the withdrawing VC firms with the coinvestors and reduce the likelihood of them entering into subsequent exchange (relational consequences). Furthermore, public information on the withdrawals can undermine the withdrawing VC firm’s reputation for reliability, making it a less desirable exchange partner overall (global reputational consequences). Finally, we find that abandoned coinvestors can spread negative private information about the withdrawing firm, reducing its chances of syndication with their other network contacts (local reputational consequences). We also show that the global and local reputational consequences attenuate each other, due to redundancy in the content of the information each provides.

Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern.

Although deference is a well-known consequence of relationships between partners of unequal status, little is known on whether deference in one domain can affect interactions between the same actors in other domains. This can happen within multiplex relationships, especially when they involve firms that have both business and personal interactions between their key decision makers. We combine insights from the literatures on status, multiplex relationships, and competitive positioning to examine how actors’ behaviors in a business domain of a multiplex relationship are shaped by the deference norms in a personal domain of the same relationship. We argue that marriages between owner-families of Korean business groups cause deferential behaviors between these families as a function of gender-based status differences within kinship ties. We show empirically that the inter-personal deference resulting from marriage affects business group market entries or exits, and in turn the group’s performance. Thus, we shed light on how deference spillovers represent a novel mechanism through which one partner can extract advantage over another within a multiplex relationship.",ok

Yet research has demonstrated that most leaders do not craft visions with image-based rhetoric, instead favoring abstract language that cannot easily be visualized. We integrate theory on leadership and dual cognitive processing to argue that this problem is exacerbated when leaders focus on word selection when crafting visions because they overemphasize the meaning-based cognitive system (in which they consider the abstract meaning of words) and underemphasize the experience-based cognitive system (in which they can generate vivid mental images of what the future could look like). We introduce a novel tactic to help leaders activate the experience-based system and, in turn, generate and communicate more impactful visions. We also investigate boundary conditions. We test our predictions with three experiments featuring three distinct samples, including one with senior corporate executives and one in which members of the British government crafted visions on the day Britain announced it would exit the European Union (“Brexit”).",ok

Stakeholders may respond by withdrawing support and starving ventures of the resources needed to thrive. This can pose an existential threat to ventures, yet it is unclear how they might manage this problem. To explore this important phenomenon, we conduct a qualitative process study of the Impossible Project, a photography venture that encountered significant resistance from its user community as it pivoted from an analog focus to an analog–digital positioning. We develop a process model of stakeholder identification management that reveals how ventures can use identification reset work to defuse tensions with stakeholders whose identification with the venture is threatened. A core finding is that ventures can remove the affective hostility of stakeholders and rebuild connections with many of them by exposing their struggles, thus creating a bond focused around these shared experiences.

Marines whose leaders were judged by superiors to exhibit charismatic leader behaviors appraised challenge stressors as being more challenging, and were more likely to respond to this appraisal with higher performance. Although charismatic leader behaviors did not influence how hindrance stressors were appraised, they negated the strong negative effect of hindrance appraisals on job performance. In Study 2 (n = 270 U.S. Marines), charismatic leader behaviors were measured through the eyes of the focal Marines, and the interactions found in Study 1 were replicated.

Specifically, we argue a successful lobbying strategy consists of both the breadth of government targeted and the political connectedness of the firm. Empirical results support our contentions that lobbying breadth and political connectedness affect the benefits firms receive from lobbying, which we operationalize both using government contracts and firm economic performance. Our analyses imply that more is not always better in the case of lobbying breadth, as the benefits accrued via dispersing lobbying across more governmental entities reaches a point of diminishing returns when lobbying breadth reaches high levels. Further, political connectedness has a moderating effect on the outcomes of lobbying breadth.

Such pairings balance the systematic nature of conscientious employees with the technology’s need for user input and direction to perform tasks—resulting in a complementary match. However, the 21st century has seen the incorporation of intelligent machines (e.g., artificial intelligence, robots, and algorithms) into employees’ jobs. Unlike traditional technology, these new machines are equipped with the capability to make decisions autonomously. Thus, their nature overlaps with the orderliness subdimension of conscientious employees—resulting in a non-complementary mismatch. This calls into question whether the consensus about conscientious employees’ effectiveness with 20th-century technology applies to 21st-century jobs. Integrating complementarity and role theory, we refine this consensus. Across three studies using distinct samples (an experience sampling study, a field experiment, and an online experiment from working adults in Malaysia, Taiwan, and the United States), each focused on a different type of intelligent machine, we show not only that using intelligent machines has benefits and consequences, but, importantly, that conscientious (i.e., orderly) employees are less likely to benefit from working with them.",ok

Yet, growing evidence has suggested that, despite its notable successes in resource-rich regions, this approach creates limited impact in economically challenged locales. We address this conundrum by calling into question the crux of high-growth entrepreneurship—the pursuit of quick scaling through venture capital financing. Our field research in two entrepreneurship-nurturing organizations in Detroit reveals important heterogeneity in resourcing modes and venture growth in time and space. Specifically, we find that ventures developed through different modes of resourcing (financing vs. local bricolage) grow at different spatiotemporal scales (scaling up toward fast geographical expansion vs. scaling deep toward locally anchored endurance), and consequently generate distinctive yet complementary contributions to their depleted place of origin. Unlike scaling-up ventures whose local impact was explosive yet short-lived, scaling-deep ventures created jobs, products or services, and spillover effects that stayed local and addressed specific local problems. Building on these findings, we challenge the exclusive pursuit of high-growth entrepreneurship for poverty alleviation and suggest that entrepreneurship-driven local development requires cohabitation of ventures growing at varying scales.",ok

Dismissals had the weakest total effect on subsequent voluntary turnover, layoff announcements had the strongest and most immediate effects, and voluntary turnovers had moderate but lasting effects. We also find that these three exit reasons each exhibit a distinct pattern of subsequent turnover intensity and longevity. Based on characteristics of work units in our setting, our results correspond to a cumulative worker-level average effect of 0.17 quits following dismissals, 0.23 quits following quits, and 2.2 quits following a layoff. We find that these “multiplier” effects are concentrated among workers of similar performance: high performer exits beget high performer quits, just as low-performer exits beget low-performer quits.

Our findings suggest a recursive model of new logic construction in which council members mobilize three emotional facilitators (social emotions, moral emotions, and emotional energy) to affect three logic-construction cycles (agreeing on values, shared learning, and enacting shared values). Emotional facilitators work through three agentic mechanisms: enabling actors to become open and reflexive about their home logics and simultaneously increase their commitment to and engagement in constructing a shared governance logic. Ongoing interactions involving emotional facilitators, agentic mechanisms, and logic-construction cycles are essential in sustaining the new logic. The process model foregrounds the role of emotions in enabling dually embedded agency, thereby extending extant theory that has tended to focus narrowly on cognitive dynamics.

We test our theorizing in the scenario wherein a competitor has been attacked by a short seller, which raises the specter of a short seller attack on the focal firm. We contend that, following an attack on a competitor, chief executive officers use positive framing in earnings conference calls as an AIM tactic to deter short sellers.

We propose that their ability to do so is enhanced when they access nonlocal tacit knowledge from others working in similar contexts. We further propose that, consistent with sociological theories of social capital and trust, local socioeconomic conditions can constrain the absorption of such knowledge and thereby local venturing in their home communities.

Overall, performance enrichment from side-hustles was stronger than performance conflict.

We elaborate on this proposition specifically with respect to turnover intentions, theorizing how three discrete emotions—anger, guilt, and pride—differentially affect turnover intentions, depending on two work-related identifications: organizational and occupational. A longitudinal study involving 135 pilot instructors reporting emotions, work-related identifications, and turnover intentions over the course of one year provides general support for our proposition.

We propose that anticipatory helping, especially from helpers with higher status than the recipient, is more self-threatening to recipients than is reactive helping; hence, recipients are less likely to accept this help and more likely to lower their evaluations of both the helper’s performance and their relationship with the helper. We find support for these hypotheses with four studies and one supplemental study that use experimental and field methodologies across a range of work contexts and social exchange relationships. Because our findings imply that both peer- and higher-status employees should withhold anticipatory help, which is impractical and potentially detrimental, we identify how these helpers can instead mitigate the negative effects of anticipatory helping by signaling a more balanced social exchange relationship with the recipient. We discuss how our findings expand research on helping, social exchange, and status.",ok

Yet we know less about the pervasiveness of this depleting effect and what employees can do at work to replenish their resources. Drawing on conservation of resources theory and the ecological congruence model, we conduct a five-day diary study among customer service representatives (CSRs) to examine the extended depleting effect of surface acting and whether social interactions with coworkers (i.e., giving and receiving help) can mitigate the negative consequences of emotional labor. Momentary reports from 102 CSRs indicate that within-person daily surface acting positively predicted end-of-day emotional exhaustion, and the effect of emotional exhaustion spilled over to work engagement the following day. Analyzing the within-person moderating effects of giving and receiving help at work, we find that giving help buffered the depletion process while receiving help did not. We discuss the theoretical and practical significance of considering the temporality of the resource-depleting effects of surface acting, the role of at-work help giving in buffering the negative effect of emotional labor that could affect the sense of self, and the importance of resource congruence in influencing the efficacy of buffering effects.",ok

We argue that frame-of-reference training, an intervention that is theorized to reduce representational gaps, can facilitate coordination and subsequent performance in multiteam systems. We studied the effects of frame-of-reference training on multiteam system coordination and performance in 249 multiteam systems comprised of specialized teams. Supporting our expectations, we found that: (a) frame-of-reference training had a positive effect on multiteam system performance by enhancing between-team coordination; (b) within-team coordination improved the relationship between frame-of-reference training and between-team coordination, ultimately improving multiteam system performance; and (c) the patterns by which within-team coordination leveraged our intervention depended on teams’ specific functions.

Based on my in-depth analysis of the actions associated with creating this game-theoretic artifact, I develop a theoretical model that shows how organizational actors iteratively engage in a series of design performances to envision new sociomaterial assemblages of actors, artifacts, theories, and practices. These design performances influence routine dynamics by both eliciting mechanisms of abstracting grammars of action, exposing assumptions, distributing agency, and appraising outcomes, and by creating new assemblages that can be deployed in future routine performances. By revealing the generativity of design performances and sociomaterial assemblages, this empirical study contributes to our understanding of routine dynamics, performativity, and strategy tools.",ok

Our five-wave results reveal that perceived prestige, psychological contract fulfillment, and organizational identification rise during institutionalized socialization, then fall immediately after this period, and finally recover and stabilize as employees settle into their first assignment. Newcomers’ personal prestige markers, including academic qualifications, the proportion of in-group members in the incoming cohort, and organizational preferential treatment moderate these change patterns, which subsequently predict the speed and occurrence of newcomers’ voluntary turnover over three years of employment.",ok

We tested our model in the context of Chinese high-tech small- and medium-sized enterprises. After confirming gender differences in social role–based proclivities at the TMT level, a multiwave survey study of 373 members from 120 TMTs showed that TMT gender diversity positively affects ASO via TMT psychological safety, and this mediated effect is stronger when firm slack is lower than higher. We further interviewed 23 top managers to supplement key quantitative results. Our study advances upper echelons research on TMT gender diversity in two ways. First, it highlights the gender-specific interpersonal benefit of TMT gender diversity, which is markedly distinct from the cognitive-variety argument associated generically with TMT demographic diversity. Second, it considers both men and women in TMTs in a more balanced manner, thereby offering an alternative account to the female-focused theorization of the positive strategic implications of TMT gender diversity.",ok

Asking how development programs can be organizing tools to transform these patterns of inequality, we use a program sponsored by an Indian non-governmental organization as our empirical window and leverage data that we collected over a decade. We identify “scaffolding” as a process that enables and organizes the transformation of behavior and interaction patterns. Three interrelated mechanisms make the transformation processes adaptive and emerging alternative social orders robust: (1) mobilizing institutional, social organizational, and economic resources; (2) stabilizing new patterns of interaction that reflect an alternative social order; and (3) concealing goals that are neither anticipated nor desired by some groups. Through this analysis, we move beyond conventional thinking on unintended consequences proposed in classic studies on organizations, complement contemporary research about how organizations effect positive social change by pursuing multiple goals, and develop portable insights for organizational efforts in tackling inequality.

On the one hand, cognition researchers have emphasized managerial attention to environmental change as a key driver of adaptation. On the other hand, dynamic capabilities scholars have underscored the role of asset reconfigurations implemented amid shifting environments. However, the explanatory powers of the two perspectives have not yet been assessed comparatively. This mixed methods study uses fuzzy-set analyses of defense firms’ responses to 9/11 to model the two perspectives as potentially competing or complementary, while our findings suggest that neither dynamic capabilities nor superior cognition must be present for firms to adapt.

This paper examines the performance effects of underdog expectations, defined as individuals’ perceptions that others view them as unlikely to succeed. Integrating theory and research on self-enhancement with psychological reactance, I predict that underdog expectations have the potential to boost performance through the desire to prove others wrong when others’ credibility is in question. Studies 1 and 2 provide support for the positive relationship between underdog expectations and performance. Study 3 reveals support for the positive effect of underdog expectations on performance through the desire to prove others wrong. Study 4 demonstrates that these effects depend on the perceived credibility of observers: when observers’ expectations are seen as more credible, underdog expectations undermine performance (consistent with the Golem effect and self-fulfilling prophecy), but when observers’ expectations are viewed as less credible, underdog expectations boost performance (demonstrating the underdog effect). My theory and results challenge the assumption that perceiving low expectations from others is always detrimental, and offer meaningful insights into why and when underdog expectations increase versus inhibit performance.",ok

One important response involves establishing a boundary around an algorithm to delimit its interactions with its environment—in engineering terms, constructing an “envelope.” Yet, we know little about the process through which such envelopes are constructed. We address this issue by exploring how institutional custodians construct envelopes around disruptive algorithms. We empirically examine custodians’ responses to the high-frequency trading algorithms that disrupted the field of U.S. securities trading, focusing on the years 2009–2016. Our inductive analysis shows that custodians created an envelope with interconnected normative, governance, and practice “layers” that jointly constrained high-frequency trading. Each layer emerged as custodians “coupled” one element of the field (e.g., its values) to one aspect of the disruptive algorithms (e.g., their impacts). Our study contributes to research on the social dynamics of algorithms by generating novel theory of how envelopes around algorithms are constructed, and to research on institutional custodianship by highlighting the constructing of envelopes as a custodial response to a wide range of threats—including, but not restricted to, disruptive algorithms.",ok

Based on 59 interviews with participants that have diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, our findings elucidate that employees temporarily alter their work engagement—either by pulling back through various types of disengagement (physical, task, social) or by increasing their engagement in various elements of their work. Our findings show that disengagement is crucial in enabling employees with mental illness to balance symptom management and stable job performance. Our theoretical model specifies types of disengagement and engagement and the mechanisms that explain their relationship to wellness and work outcomes, including suffering reduction, image preservation, and distraction.

We further find this political ideology effect increases for workers with greater seniority in the organization.

Two experiments involving practicing managers follow. Study 3 exposes managers to comparative political information featuring a U.S. Senate election; we observe an increase in spending on training and development programs. Study 4 exposes managers to comparative political information for state-level political races, finding that doing so reduces the importance of negative information in the subsequent managerial decision process and leads to increased marketing spending. Moreover, shifting the decision frame from selecting to rejecting options restores the focus on negative information and attenuates the effect.

Classical organization theory prescribes unity of command, achieved by combining the chief executive officer (CEO) and board chair positions; in contrast, agency theory prescribes independent monitoring, achieved by separating the CEO and board chair positions. Extant theory does not acknowledge the possibility that a compromise might exist between these competing theoretical prescriptions, one which might reduce their mutual exclusivity. Such a compromise has emerged in practice, however: the lead independent director. In the present research, we initiate theoretical exploration of this compromise between the prescriptions of agency theory and classical organization theory, addressing the questions of when a board will choose to appoint a lead independent director, who among the independent directors will serve in the position, how lead independent director appointment will impact firm performance, and whether this compromise is a permanent solution or a stepping stone to a more extreme outcome.

We argue that existing theory largely ignores the founder’s role as a team catalyst who mobilizes a team and transmits the team’s knowledge to a new venture. We address this gap by building theory on the role of a spin-out founder as a facilitator of co-mobility and whose impact on firm outcomes is mediated by the size and organizational experience of the recruited team. The support for our hypotheses, through use of linked employee–employer U.S. Census data from the legal services industry, has theoretical and practical implications for the knowledge-based view and human resource strategies for both existing and entrepreneurial firms.",ok

We argue that the motivation to pursue radical invention will be strongest when performance is moderately below aspiration, and will weaken as performance either falls substantially below aspiration or rises substantially above aspiration. At the same time, ability will increase with performance, resulting in a behavioral mismatch between ability and motivation—firms overinvest in radical invention when performance is moderately below aspiration and underinvest when performance is substantially above aspiration, with these effects being stronger for broad, multi-technology firms. We show empirical support for our arguments using patent data, using an empirical approach that distinguishes the potential radicalness of an invention from its eventual success. Our study highlights the role of established firms as a source of radical technologies, and examines the behavioral biases that may limit firms from pursuing competence-enhancing radical technologies.",ok

We find that audiences stigmatize an organization because they fear that it threatens a particular moral order, which leads them to mount sustained attacks designed to weaken or eradicate the organization. Our model suggests that an organization that experiences this form of profound disapproval can nonetheless purge its stigma and become legitimate through a two-step process: first the organization engages in stigma reduction work designed to minimize overt hostility among audiences by showing that it does not pose a risk to them. Second it engages in stigma elimination work designed to gain support from stigmatizers by showing that it plays a positive role in society. Our study therefore reorients organizational stigma research from a focus on how organizations can cope with the effects of stigma, and considers instead how they can eradicate the stigma altogether. We also shed light on much neglected audience-level dynamics by examining the process through which audiences construct stigma and why these constructions may change.",ok

We tested our model in a sample of 746 Chinese listed firms during the period 2009–2014 when a national CSR initiative, the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, took place. Our results show that firms responded positively to the plan by increasing their CSR performance, but their response varied according to the incentives of both public and private CSR agents. Firms were more likely to increase CSR when public agents were more motivated to seek promotion to the central government or when private agents had greater concerns for legitimacy. Our examination of the role of two different types of CSR agents within institutions contributes to the institutional view of CSR by highlighting the interplay of institutions and human agents in promoting firm CSR.

We posit that CEOs from the postreform generation are more likely to transfer material private information via their school ties, while prereform-generation CEOs favor caste or language ties. Contrasting domestic business groups (BGs) with Western multinational corporations (MNCs) as organizational contexts, we argue that BGs legitimate the transfer of private information along particularistic ties, whereas MNCs mitigate such transfers. Our conceptual framework is supported by analyses that draw on a sample of 1,552 earnings forecasts issued between 2001 and 2010 by 296 equity analysts. Our findings suggest that the embeddedness perspective should be broadened to incorporate the influence of the larger historical social structures within which economic action is embedded, and to view BGs as carriers and repositories that blend modern management practices with particularistic behavioral patterns among top executives.",ok

High task segmentation occurs when a large chunk of work time is segmented by categorically different temporal markers. We tested a model in which temporal predictability and task segmentation affect experienced passage of time, which in turn influences job performance, with five studies: two experiments that established the internal validity of temporal predictability and task segmentation (Studies 1a and 1b), a naturalistic field study in a factory that investigated the natural consequences of distinct temporal work design (Study 2), an organizational field study that constructively replicated the model using a sample of knowledge workers and their supervisors (Study 3), and an online survey in which we connected our model with the broader work design literature (Study 4).

In Study 1, using data extracted from continuous audio and video streams of paramedics participating in live-actor mass-casualty response exercises, we found that sending within-team conflict and receiving between-team conflict related positively with task performance, whereas receiving within-team conflict related negatively to task performance. In Study 2, we conducted a mixed-design scenario-based experiment to examine the underlying mechanisms that drive such effects. Our findings reveal that on-task attentional pull was an important mechanism for a positive sending within-team conflict–task engagement relationship, whereas off-task attentional demands were driving the negative receiving within-team conflict–task engagement relationship. Collectively, we demonstrate that examining the intra-individual microfoundations of conflict in a multiteam context yields unique insights and enables building new theory on when and why conflict is beneficial or harmful.",ok

Using five years of post-initial public offering data on 218 firms that went public between 2001 and 2005, we find that overlaps in directors’ local status characteristics captured by their shared tenure and expertise and directors’ global status homogeneity increase the likelihood of board turnover.

We hypothesize that, due to the historical influence of the media and social movement organizations on politics, negative national media tenor and oppositional social movement organization resources increase state uncertainty (i.e., government’s likely behavior toward firms becomes less predictable), strengthening the relationship between firms’ dependence on jurisdictions and their use of political contributions in those jurisdictions. Further, we hypothesize that top management team turnover and politician turnover increase response uncertainty (i.e., the effectiveness of firms’ efforts to manage their dependence becomes less clear), weakening the relationship between dependence and political contributions. We find support for our theory in an examination of state-level political contributions of firms in environmentally intensive industries from 2009 to 2016.

Our theory and findings ultimately suggest that, due to the multiple sources of social identification between CEOs, journalists who engage in negative coverage of firm leadership tend to experience social distancing from multiple CEOs, and that such distancing has a powerful influence on the valence of journalists’ subsequent reporting about firm leadership and strategy across all the firms they cover.

The conception of learning—a process that involved finding a place in relation to significant counterparts, taking a stance on learning, and building learning spaces—allowed them to craft identities that gave meaning and direction to their work, grounding their identity as leaders. Not all marginal leaders took the same trajectory toward firm ground for their identities. Some left the margins to lead, embracing either an instrumental or a humanistic view of their function. Others learned to lead from the margins, casting that duality as a paradox. Taking a systems psychodynamic approach to examine marginal leaders’ trajectories through a defining duality, this study reveals the interplay between existential and strategic layers of leader identity construction.

To build new understanding of these important dynamics, we conducted an ethnographic study of three ventures in an Australian accelerator. Our study reveals three distinct legitimation pathways that ventures may follow when seeking legitimacy from a make-or-break audience—the obedient, pragmatic, and rebellious paths. We find that these pathways are jointly shaped by the expectations of the audience, the emotional experiences of founders, and founders’ reactions to these emotions in the context of perceived venture performance. We contribute to organizational scholarship by identifying a novel set of new venture legitimation pathways that incorporate emotion, conceptualizing “venture work” as a distinct type of social-symbolic work designed to legitimate startups and shedding new light on the role of new venture support organizations in entrepreneurial ecosystems.",ok

Multiple projects worked to reduce this ambiguity, importing temporal structures from organizational innovation processes and compressing them to fit the extremely limited and ad hoc time frame. They worked in full coordination to build a new product. They all failed.

Using data on the formation of collaboration ties with star scientists within the research and development laboratories of the 42 largest pharmaceutical companies between 1985 and 2010, we show that women who are geographically colocated with a “star” colleague are less likely to form a tie with that colleague compared to male peers who are similarly colocated, and that this difference persists irrespective of the star’s gender. Conversely, women benefit more than men do from network proximity, as indicated by the presence of common third-party ties, and this difference widens if the star colleague is also a woman. By illuminating how geographic and network proximity affect the chances of forming high-status connections differently for women than for men, our study goes beyond the notion that women have reduced access to workplace social capital and expands consideration to the structural factors that underpin—that is, amplify or reduce—that disadvantage.",ok

To understand this, we apply and extend the institutional logics perspective. Our approach recognizes that practices within different sectors of a society may be shaped by different organizing principles. However, we suggest practices are also likely to reflect—to varying degrees—broader societal logics. Based on this, we argue that societal logics may work through multiple influence channels and affect organizations in non-obvious ways, depending on how, where, and with what intensity they manifest in society. We test our theory by analyzing how patriarchy, as a societal-level logic, affects outreach to women by microfinance organizations in 115 nations. We find that patriarchy supports practices in the family, religion, professions, and state that suppress this outreach. Yet, in some nations, patriarchy is differently evident across sectors. The resulting contrasts draw attention to women’s issues, motivate redress efforts, and catalyze resource flows to microfinance organizations. The greatest outreach to women is in these nations.",ok

We develop and test theory regarding how voice emerges and develops in new supervisor–employee dyads. We propose that employees higher in proactive personality speak up more in early stages of interactions in their dyads. The subsequent path that their voice takes—that is, increasing in a virtuous positive trajectory or decreasing in a vicious negative trajectory—is determined by whether their proactive personality matches their supervisors’. For instance, when paired with supervisors who are not similarly proactive, they confront low congruence on change-related goals in the working relationship; hence, rather than building off their initial voice and developing a positive voice trajectory, frustration might lead their voice to decay in a negative trajectory. This theory is supported in a sample of 403 newly formed dyads. Employees higher in proactive personality were more likely to speak up to their supervisors immediately after beginning to work together. Supervisor–employee congruence in proactive personality predicted how voice changed in the dyads in the ensuing six months.

Whether helping is perceived favorably by recipients depends on the underlying motives they attribute to the helper, which raises the questions of when and how recipients may attribute different motives to helping. To explain when and how those receiving help make these attributions, we adopt a social-functional approach to emotions to examine the impact of the social information conveyed through discrete emotional expressions. We draw on the framework of emotions as social information to theorize that the helper’s emotional expressions act as signals of social engagement or disengagement that differentially impact the recipient’s attribution of motives and reactions to help. Across three studies, we find that helpers’ expressions of socially engaging emotions (gratitude and sympathy) lead to greater attributions of prosocial motives, whereas expressions of socially disengaging emotions (pride and contempt) lead to greater attributions of instrumental motives. We find that the effect of these expressed emotions on relationship quality and reciprocation toward the helper is mediated by the recipient’s attribution of prosocial motives but not by the attribution of instrumental motives.",ok

We pivot from this predominant logic and argue that, under certain circumstances, targets of abusive supervision may blame themselves, feel guilty, and then try to make it up to their abusive supervisors by helping them more. Drawing on the emotional process theory of abusive supervision and the more general sociofunctional perspective of emotions, we specify that such a dynamic is more likely to ensue when subordinates otherwise experience the relationship with their supervisors as good (high LMX). Two studies—an experiment and a two-week bi-daily experience sampling study—provide support for our reasoning. As such, our study extends theorizing on the consequences of abusive supervision, which has typically found that it reduces cooperative behaviors.

My theory is grounded in the strategy-based notion that combining organizational resources—leading by example (practical element) and organizational core values (conceptual element)—optimizes employee engagement, which in turn enhances productivity and service quality. I examine my model empirically using two-time-point panel data derived from three different sources (employees, financial data, and secret shoppers) in a sample of 233 retail stores. The findings provide evidence that leading by example improves productivity and service quality (after taking into account the potential influence of charismatic leadership). The indirect effect of leading by example on productivity and service quality (through engagement) is even stronger when manifestation of organizational core values is high.

We investigate the speed of opportunity-evaluation decisions by focusing on firms’ venture termination and venture advancement decisions. Experience, standard operating procedures, and confidence allow firms to make opportunity-evaluation decisions faster; we propose that a firm’s attentional orientation, as reflected in its project portfolio, limits the number of domains in which these speed-enhancing mechanisms can be developed. Hence, firms’ decision speed is likely to vary between different types of decisions. Using unique data on 3,269 mineral exploration ventures in the Australian mining industry, we find that firms with a higher degree of attention toward earlier-stage exploration activities are quicker to abandon potential opportunities in early development but slower to do so later, and that such firms are also slower to advance on potential opportunities at all stages compared to firms that focus their attention differently. Market dynamism moderates these relationships, but only with regard to initial evaluation decisions. Our study extends research on decision speed by showing that firms are not necessarily fast or slow regarding all the decisions they make, and by offering an opportunity-evaluation framework that recognizes that decision makers can—in fact, often do—pursue multiple potential opportunities simultaneously.",ok

Extant theory posits that, due to information asymmetry, stakeholders struggle to comprehend the actual change in firms’ practices. In contrast, we advance a cognitive-linguistic perspective to explain why stakeholders are sometimes misled. Accordingly, we propose that firms’ deception does not appear in the content of their communication, but in its linguistic properties, which derive from how managers cognitively construe the sustainability challenge. Thus, firms cover the same points of content in their reports, but firms that practice what they preach use more complex styles of language than do firms that decouple their action from their statements. Moreover, we theorize that generalist stakeholders and stakeholders with conflicts of interest are unable to detect these linguistic nuances, whereas specialist stakeholders can. We find evidence for this cognitive-linguistic perspective in a textual analysis of grammatical structure in 261 interviews conducted in a large field study of 12 multinational corporations and their stakeholders. This lens advances our understanding of how firms deceive and how stakeholders can detect such deception and opens a new and promising avenue for research on firm–stakeholder relations.",ok

Specifically, we examine how each frame influences the way underpricing is interpreted, and how these interpretations, as well as the joint effects of possessing status and celebrity, influence newly public firms’ strategic alliance formations. We explore these ideas in the ambiguity-ridden context of “Dot-Com” firms during the commercial dawn of the Internet.

Soliciting suggestions is a form of distant search, since it allows organizations to tap into knowledge that may not reside within their organizational boundaries. Organizations engaging in distant search often face a large pool of suggestions, an outcome we refer to as crowding. When crowding occurs, organizations, given a limited attention span, can attend to only a subset of suggestions. Our core argument is that crowding narrows the attention of organizations; that is, despite organizations’ efforts to reach out to external contributors and access suggestions that capture distant knowledge, they are more likely to pay attention to suggestions that are familiar, not distant. We test our theory with a unique longitudinal dataset that captures how 922 organizations responded to 105,127 crowdsourced suggestions from external contributors. After distinguishing between three different dimensions of distance (content, structural, and personal), we find that (a) all three types of distance have independent negative effects on the likelihood of attention, (b) crowding amplifies these negative effects, and (c) there are differences among the effects’ magnitudes. We elaborate on the broader implications of these findings for the literatures on attention, search, and crowdsourcing.",ok

Two divergent schools of thought emerge: an “embeddedness as a buffer” logic, wherein embedded partners may be more forgiving, versus an “et tu Brute” logic, wherein embedded partners feel betrayed. We tackle this theoretical tension by examining brokerage relationships. When spatially or relationally embedded, focal firm–broker ties further enhance trust but the ensuing higher expectations also make embedded trust more brittle due to the broker’s divided loyalties, resulting in a steeper decline in trust after a violation. Our central hypotheses thus highlight a paradox of embeddedness: while spatial and relational trust foster repeat ties under normal circumstances, it takes proportionately longer for such embedded ties to be reinitiated when trust is violated. We use a unique hand-collected data set in the global dry cargo shipping industry with voyage-level data on 3,618 exchanges between a Copenhagen-based shipowner–operator (the focal firm) and 235 shipbrokers from 2011 to 2018 and a Weibull hazard rate estimator.

This is a crucial issue, especially for peripheral actors lacking the resources, status, or power of more central ones. Our historical analysis focuses on the long-term struggle of the Cree First Nation in Canada and explains how they succeeded in increasing their dispositional legitimacy in and through the settlements. This required work in three interrelated processes: expansive argumentation, including problematizing of the state of affairs and creating discursive resonance with the prevailing discourses and values; building momentum by generating attention and exerting pressure in networks of actors; and seizing opportunities to negotiate with the other side. Thus, we challenge previous research on settlements by showing how they should not merely be seen as endpoints but rather as stepping-stones in a trajectory of institutional change.

While existing research on categories has shed light on how such new category meanings and boundaries may be shaped, we lack insight on how this happens in the absence of category prototypes that demarcate the meaning and membership of categories. We turn to category exemplars as an important but, as yet, poorly understood tool influencing category formation and subsequent membership. We conduct a systematic analysis of discourse surrounding the formation of the new category of modern slavery to identify three distinct forms of exemplars (typifying, familiarizing, and scoping), and develop a model that links actors’ use of these exemplars to specific boundary effects across four phases of category formation. We also reveal the conditions under which different exemplars were successful in influencing the final category.

Our emergent findings reframe current theorizing on feedback by revealing its interactive nature: feedback providers and creative workers co-construct a problem space that provides openings for changing prototypes. Our analysis revealed sets of moves that feedback providers (personalizing, puzzling, measuring, and prescribing) and creative workers (backgrounding, forecasting, and opening) use to interact. We also found evidence that patterns among these moves helped guide one of two responses: (1) excavations, when feedback spurs comprehensive changes by prompting creative workers to return to old ideas, and (2) adjustments, when feedback spurs incremental refinements to the prototype.

Identity centrality is focused inward on the extent to which an identity is important and salient to an individual, whereas solidarity is focused outward on the strength of the bond an individual perceives with another person or group. We propose that higher centrality exacerbates reactions to identity threat and ultimately predicts identity-protection responses (e.g., derogating or avoiding the threat source), whereas greater solidarity with coworkers mitigates negative responses stemming from identity threat. We consider two groups with whom individuals might experience solidarity in organizations: (1) others who share the threatened identity and (2) coworkers. We test and find support for our hypotheses in two studies using two-wave, time-lagged online experimental methods investigating political identity (Study 1) and working parent identity (Study 2). Notably, solidarity with coworkers provides a buffering effect while solidarity with others sharing the threatened identity does so to a lesser degree.

We draw on status characteristics theory to derive predictions on how co-founders’ specific expertise cues and diffuse status cues drive initial task position allocation. We also examine the performance consequences of mismatches between the task position and position occupant. Qualitative fieldwork, combined with a quasi-experimental simulation game and an experiment, provides causal tests of the conceptual framework. We find that co-founders whose diffuse status cues of gender (male), ethnicity (white), or achievement (occupational prestige or academic honors) indicated general ability were typical occupants of higher-ranked positions, such as chief executive officer role, within the founding team. In addition, specific expertise cues that indicated relevant ability predicted task position allocation. Founding teams created more financially valuable ventures when task position occupants’ diffuse status cues were typical for the position; nonetheless position occupants with high diffuse status cues also appropriated more of the created value.

Cultural entrepreneurship research spotlights such resources as the ingredients around which entrepreneurs construct distinctive narratives and proposes that resource-rich ventures will present themselves as particularly distinctive. Challenging this, we argue that ventures rich in quality-signaling resources—while ideally positioned to convey their distinctiveness—will likely forgo this symbolic differentiation opportunity under certain industry conditions due to a lack of external incentives. Our analysis of 31,270 UK-based ventures launched between 2010 and 2021 finds that, compared to patent-poor ventures, patent-rich ventures exhibit higher levels of narrative distinctiveness when situated in industries that receive little attention, but substantially lower levels of narrative distinctiveness when situated in hot industries that attract a lot of attention. In doing so, our study challenges the assumption that entrepreneurial ventures always aim to present themselves as distinctive as legitimately possible, delineates conditions under which this assumption is likely violated, and lays the groundwork for a broader research agenda on organizations’ substantive and symbolic differentiation.",ok

Instruments engendered incipient interdisciplinary possibilities, but they required the students—engaging in symbiont practices—to actualize that potential. Simultaneously, students required instruments in order to be classified, staffed on projects, and placed in jobs. These practices resolved both the cognitive and economic challenges of boundary spanning by mobilizing material resources that were costly (cognitively and politically) for actors on either side of the disciplinary divide to engage.

We suggest that progress in this debate has been hampered by a lack of clarity about hierarchy and how to conceptualize it. Whereas prevailing conceptualizations of hierarchy in the group and organization literature have focused on inequality in member power or status (i.e., centralization or steepness), we build on the ethological and social network traditions to advance a view of hierarchy as cascading relations of dyadic influence (i.e., acyclicity). We suggest that hierarchy thus conceptualized is more likely to capture the functional benefits of hierarchy, whereas hierarchy as inequality is more likely to be dysfunctional. In a study of 75 teams drawn from a range of industries, we show that whereas acyclicity in influence relations reduces conflict and thereby enhances both group performance and member satisfaction, centralization and steepness have negative effects on conflict, performance, and satisfaction, particularly in groups that perform complex tasks.

Using a time-lagged experience sampling methodology, our hypotheses were tested in a sample of 98 professionals who completed twice-daily surveys over a two-week period. Study results confirm our hypotheses that experiencing daily empowering leadership enhances employees’ next morning proactive behaviors of risk-taking and voice behavior due to more proactive goal setting at the start of the workday.

While long envisioning how leaders motivate subordinates to stay, management scholars have largely neglected how teams in which leaders belong (e.g., top management teams [TMT]) constitute an organizational context that moderates their ability to retain subordinates. Building on recent theory and research that a leader’s humility discourages subordinates from voluntarily departing by increasing their job satisfaction, we propose that faultlines in TMTs can exert cross-level effects attenuating how humble executives sustain MMs’ job satisfaction, and how MMs’ job dissatisfaction drives their voluntary turnover. We verify these effects with a multisource, multiphase dataset of 43 TMTs, 313 top executives, and 502 MMs. Our study thus bridges the macro and micro divide to offer a multilevel inquiry into contextual influences on voluntary turnover, identifies a boundary condition for leader humility effects, and clarifies how TMT faultlines represent a contextual constraint on how top executives induce MM subordinates to stay.",ok

Given the economic benefits of helping, it seems important that, during difficult economic periods, the amount of helping does not decline. Yet, in this research, we propose and show that it does. We argue that cues that signal the economy is performing poorly prompt a construal that the success of one person implies less success for others. This zero-sum construal of success in turn makes employees less inclined to help. Four studies found evidence consistent with our theory. Study 1 found that worse economic periods are associated with a more zero-sum construal of success, using data from 59,694 respondents surveyed across 51 countries and 17 years and objective indicators of their macroeconomic environments. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally induced the perception that the U.S. economy was performing poorly with a sample of U.S. employees and found that this perception led employees to have a more zero-sum construal of success and made them less inclined to help. Study 4 was an unobtrusive experiment carried out among freelance professionals from 47 countries, and it found that participants’ perception that the economy in their country was in a downturn was associated with a more zero-sum construal of success and less helping behavior.

Given broad acceptance for the important role that networks play in facilitating entrepreneurship at the firm level, we contend that adopting a network-based view of EEs may also help predict and explain aggregate entrepreneurial outcomes at the EE level. Specifically, we adopt a double embeddedness lens to examine the impact of both inter-EE (i.e., structural embeddedness) and intra-EE (i.e., cultural embeddedness) factors on EE-level new venture creation. Using a longitudinal sample of regional data in the United States from 1994 to 2016, we develop and test hypotheses where the relationship between structural embeddedness and new venture creation follows an inverted “U” shape that is itself moderated by cultural embeddedness.

We examine career advisers in undergraduate business schools, whose occupational values often contrasted with values common among their student clients. Through an ethnography of one school’s career advisers, combined with interviews of such advisers throughout the United States, we find that advisers navigated interactions by discerning student values and accordingly modulating their value-enactment practices through masking, moderating, or magnifying their values. This allowed advisers to uphold their jurisdictional control when facing students exhibiting incongruent values, while enacting their values with students exhibiting unclear or congruent values. We contribute to the relational perspective on occupations and professions by positing how discernment and modulation help experts navigate relational tensions by recognizing and drawing on intraclientele heterogeneity, unpacking how professionals might not entirely resist or change amid incongruence but instead pursue a more mixed approach, and highlighting when and how experts mask or moderate rather than overtly enact their values.",ok

Our research provides clarity on the dynamic nature of performance pressure. We theorize that reactions to performance pressure are influenced by daily fluctuations in how the pressure is appraised, and these fluctuations explain why performance pressure can be a double-edged sword, producing bright and dark side effects for organizations. We predict that, on a daily basis, performance pressure may be appraised as a threat, which promotes self-regulation depletion that explains dysfunctional behavior (i.e., incivility); daily performance pressure may also be appraised as a challenge, which elicits engagement that explains enhanced task proficiency and citizenship. Trait resilience is predicted to moderate these effects, promoting performance pressure to be appraised as a challenge rather than a threat, which then mitigates the depleting effects that produce dysfunctional behavior and enhances the engaging effects that produce functional behavior.

We test our hypotheses on a sample of legislative references associated with National Collegiate Athletic Association major infractions from 1999–2009.

Building on research on resilience, resourcefulness, and crisis management, we induce a process model that unpacks the mechanisms and dynamics that enable organizations to act resiliently. We find that organizations approach adversity using two types of resourcefulness. Promotive resourcefulness focuses on opportunities from adversity, which leads to acting resiliently. We show how promotive resourcefulness becomes sustained over time by endogenously producing resources—crisis agency, trust, and hopefulness—which expands an organization’s identity and leads to resilient acts. In contrast, preventative resourcefulness focuses on minimizing worst-case outcomes, which leads to a lost organizational identity and relatively weak adversity adjustment. We find that preventative resourcefulness becomes part of cycles that erode trust, limit crisis agency, and generate hopelessness. Additionally, we explain how financial, emotional, and operational updating can shift preventative to promotive resourcefulness, allowing organizations to act resiliently later in a crisis. Our findings unpack critical mechanisms and processes that explain whether and how organizations act resiliently over time.",ok

Our qualitative study of entrepreneurs in the sex industry in Canada reveals that the many constraints faced by entrepreneurs in stigmatized industries also create opportunities. Actualizing such stigma-based opportunities loosens the constraints of stigma and enables entrepreneurs to experience structural, cognitive, and emotional emancipation.

We further differentiate voice and silence by identifying their distinct effects on employee burnout. In Study 1, a meta-analysis, we demonstrate that voice and silence are independent (Mρ = −.15) and that perceived impact (psychological safety) relates more strongly to voice (silence) than to silence (voice).

We examine this argument by developing an institutional theory of corporate giving and testing our hypotheses using the corporate giving behaviors of publicly listed Korean companies from 2003 to 2011. Consistent with our proposition concerning the role of external audiences in shaping legitimacy management costs, we show that strategic decisions regarding how much a firm spends on corporate giving are related to the extent that the firm receives positive or negative media attention. Furthermore, we find that the relationship between media evaluations and corporate giving varies with a firm’s performance, which suggests that its internal efficiency condition can be an important contingency factor in determining its legitimacy management cost.

We theorize that as job searches progress across time or discrete events, temporal-based pressure increases via perceptions that situations are less changeable or more critical, propelling envious job seekers toward deviant rather than normative search behavior. We propose that market-based pressure, deriving from employment opportunity perceptions, further moderates these effects. In a first study of unemployed job seekers, after more search time passes, job search envy relates to deviant search behavior. Market pressure further qualifies this relationship, although contrary to our prediction, lower market pressure exacerbates rather than attenuates the relationship. Study 2, a two-year study of graduate students engaged in internship and full-time job searches, focuses on event-based temporal pressure and mostly replicates the Study 1 findings. It also indicates that under lower event and market pressures, job seekers expend more effort but do not commit resume fraud in response to job search envy.

Guided by institutional theory, we focus on two important questions: (a) are the antecedents of restructuring common across downsizing and upsizing? and (b) are the performance consequences of such restructuring related to prior firm performance? To answer these questions, we use primary data from companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange over a 37-year period (1980–2016). Our results suggest that six key antecedents play a prominent role in both downsizing and upsizing, although they differ in magnitude and direction in how they affect each form of restructuring. However, in both instances they reflect efficiency considerations (company performance and managerial foresight), as well as institutional forces (the economy, political uncertainty, industry, and technology), just as neo-institutional theory suggests. In addition, prior performance plays a central role in restructuring decisions, in both the upsizing and downsizing of assets and employees. The evidence suggests that it is not just current-year performance but also the trend in company performance over the prior two years that forecasts subsequent firm performance; thus, our findings extend and refine institutional theory.",ok

Above this threshold, increased participative leadership is related to higher employee performance. Building on adaptive resonance theory (Grossberg, 1999), a variant of implicit leadership theory, we further hypothesize that leaders’ information-sharing behavior will moderate this curvilinear relationship. We test this model using two independent samples: office and call-center employees (Study 1) and factory workers (Study 2). Results from Study 1 reveal that this curvilinear relationship is stronger when leaders’ information sharing is high and weaker when information sharing is low.

However, existing theory is unclear on when and why some cover-ups are punished less severely by in-group third parties compared to out-group third parties. Drawing on theories of attribution and social identity, we theorize that the punishment of cover-ups by in- and out-group third parties depends on the type of cover-up: specifically, whether individuals conceal their own unethical transgressions (personal cover-ups) or the unethical transgressions of another individual (relational cover-ups). By highlighting this distinction, we hypothesize and find across three studies that in-group third parties punish relational—but not personal—cover-ups less severely than out-group third parties. Moreover, we theorize and find support for the mediating role of perceptions of group loyalty. Our theory and results reveal the ways in which different forms of cover-ups can escape severe punishment, and offer important theoretical contributions for research on unethical behavior, social identity, and loyalty.",ok

However, individuals’ advice-giving actions do not guarantee increases in recipients’ creativity and, in some cases, may even be a creative liability for the giver’s own subsequent creativity. We argue that considering advice givers’ brokerage in the team’s advice-giving network (i.e., advice brokerage) may clarify this phenomenon. Specifically, we posit that advice given from a brokerage position contains more nonredundant content that boosts recipients’ creativity. Further, we expect advice brokerage to positively influence a giver’s own creativity, though this effect is at least partially explained via recipients’ proximal creativity gains (e.g., recipients’ creativity change mediates the relationship). Recipients’ perceptions of psychological safety accentuate these relationships. Longitudinal field data support the main hypotheses, but also suggest that advice brokerage has more immediate proximal effects on givers’ creativity; an additional qualitative study elucidates several mechanisms by which brokered advice boosts creativity, including two associated with generating diverse ideas (idea integration, perspective-taking), two associated with domain-specific knowledge accumulation (knowledge accumulation, reflection), collective creativity, and creative feedback.

We utilize multiple methods to abductively develop and test our theory. First, we conduct a qualitative comparative analysis of 51 cases of financial misconduct among S&P 1500 firms that disclosed a misstatement via press release and dismissed either the CEO or CFO within 90 days of the disclosure. Analyzing aspects of these firms’ crisis communication and the type of dismissal executed, this study reveals four configurations that highlight the influence of crisis management (in)coherence on shareholder trust. Second, a policy-capturing study examines the underlying mechanisms that drive shareholders’ perceptions and intended behaviors relative to manipulated crisis management strategies in a controlled setting. Together, findings from these studies indicate that shareholder trust following misconduct depends in part on the (in)coherence between what firms say about their misconduct, how they communicate that information, and what they do to resolve the problem.",ok

To answer these questions, we adopt a knowledge-based view of hiring to develop new theory about how returning former employees’ (“boomerangs”) post-hire performance might differ from that of external hires who have no previous experience with the firm (“new hires”). We theorize that, relative to new hires, boomerangs’ familiarity with the organization’s social system will allow them to more effectively engage in coordination and overcome internal resistance from organizational incumbents. As a consequence, boomerangs should have a particular advantage in roles that require a higher degree of coordination and in units that are likely to be more resistant to outsiders. Comparing the post-hire performance of 2,053 boomerangs and 10,858 new hires over an eight-year period in a large health care organization, we find that, upon being (re)hired into the organization, boomerangs outperform new hires in their initial job spell and that this performance advantage is larger in jobs requiring greater internal coordination and in contexts characterized by greater internal resistance to external hires.",ok

Drawing on the focus theory of normative conduct, I argue that employees’ use of moral frames can be a double-edged sword for motivating majority group leaders to support DEI initiatives. On the one hand, moral framing can heighten majority group leaders’ psychological standing, thereby increasing their support for DEI initiatives. On the other hand, moral framing can trigger psychological reactance for majority group leaders, thereby reducing their support for DEI initiatives. To reconcile these competing pathways, I argue that, when employees emphasize majority group leaders’ problem-solving autonomy concerning how to address DEI issues, moral framing has a stronger effect on psychological standing and a weaker effect on psychological reactance, thus enhancing majority group leaders’ overall support for DEI initiatives.

In this paper we report on a mixed-method field study examining sanctioning behavior. Our goal is to extend theories of sanctioning by evaluating the conditions under which individuals are more likely to administer a sanction in response to a norm violation. To guide the development of our hypotheses, we engage in a qualitative examination of sanctioning decisions in the context of gourmet cuisine. We then test our predictions in a field experiment involving more than 500 gourmet chefs in Italy. Our results suggest that individuals follow retributive instincts, but they also engage in cost–benefit calculations. Indeed, we find that the two logics of sanctioning jointly influence participation in social exchange.

A total of 666 mature-age employees in Australia described their work experiences in three surveys administered over a three-year period. Results indicated that mature-age employees who experienced stereotype threat in the workplace reported lower engagement 11–12 months later. All of the contextual cues had an impact on stereotype threat and exerted indirect (mediated by stereotype threat) effects on engagement. However, the effects of manager age were moderated by organizational practices. Diversity conscious mature-age practices moderated the indirect effect of manager age, so mature-age practices were particularly beneficial in counteracting negative cues associated with young managers. But diversity blind high performance practices moderated the direct effect of manager age, so high performance practices were especially helpful in generating engagement among mature-age workers with older managers. We recommend that organizations adopt both diversity blind and diversity conscious practices into their diversity management portfolios. The two types of practices are complementary and have additive effects on mature-age worker engagement.",ok

Likewise, collaborative activists encounter organizations with a wide range of prior reform experience, and the resulting “opportunity structure” for collaboration is not well understood.

Our analysis combines surveys, interviews, and archival records from the Environmental Defense Fund’s Climate Corps program, which embeds graduate students in partner organizations to advance climate change reforms.

The behavioral agency model predicts that loss-averse family firms discount their shares more than nonfamily firms to minimize losses of socioemotional wealth (SEW). Conversely, the endowment effect in prospect theory suggests that family owners maximize their financial wealth (FW) by including SEW in perceptions of firm value and demanding a higher IPO price to relinquish it. We reconcile these seemingly incompatible predictions by examining dynamic properties of the reference point in decision framing. Conceiving IPO pricing as a two-stage gamble, we theorize that initial SEW losses entailed by the listing decision increase the disposition of family owners to underprice IPO shares to possibly offset these losses, or “break even.” We thereby advance the behavioral agency model with the aversion to loss realization logic to explain how family owners’ decision frames and preferences change during the IPO process, depending on initial losses of current SEW and new expectations of future SEW. Our analysis of 1,807 IPOs in Europe supports our theoretical expectations, clarifying the trade-off between FW and SEW and explicating the dynamic properties of mixed gambles in family firms.",ok

This paper reconciles both streams of research by proposing that startups can combine both types of experience-based advantages when founding teams are composed of founders who individually possess a variety of firm experiences and other founders who jointly transition from the same industry incumbent. Using a sample of startups in technological manufacturing industries, I test the direct effect of the two types of experiences and their complementarity in decreasing the likelihood of startup failure. The results show that such complementarities exist so that startups are less likely to fail when their founding teams combine within-founder experience variety and across-team shared experience.

Specifically, the investigation offers new knowledge of how organizational identity processes can shape whether decision-makers will resist versus give in to environmental pressures. Building on the notion that organizational identity acts as a filter through which decision-makers relate to the external environment, I develop the theoretical argument that strong organizational identification increases resistance to environmental pressures due to two mechanisms: (1) it bolsters the decision-maker’s certainty and (2) it deflects the decision-maker’s attention from the environment. A series of laboratory experiments not only test the mediated relationship between organizational identification and resistance to environmental pressures but also contrast different types of organizational identity. The empirical results support the hypothesized positive link between organizational identification and resistance, which becomes particularly strong when the organizational identity is normative (vs. utilitarian).

First, we provide causal evidence from a field experiment conducted at a telemarketing company. We find that AI assistance in generating sales leads, on average, increases employees’ creativity in answering customers’ questions during subsequent sales persuasion. Enhanced creativity leads to increased sales. However, this effect is much more pronounced for higher-skilled employees. Next, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with the employees. We found that AI assistance changes job design by intensifying employees’ interactions with more serious customers. This change enables higher-skilled employees to generate innovative scripts and develop positive emotions at work, which are conducive to creativity. By contrast, with AI assistance, lower-skilled employees make limited improvements to scripts and experience negative emotions at work.

We argue that the latter represent exogenous indices that affect evaluators in two opposing ways: they positively influence peer valuation by pointing to candidates’ unobservable abilities, yet, since they are conferred by an external audience, they are also indicative of candidates’ deviation from an expected peer identity. The combination of the two opposite effects suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between exogenous indices and peer valuation. Further, this effect is moderated by the identity proximity between audiences, and the availability of previous peer evaluations (endogenous indices).

We suggest that it is the presence or absence of an “identity buffer”—i.e., a relative identity advantage—that determines insiders’ reaction. We hypothesize that when a fellow category insider introduces a code violation, the focal insider will be more likely to refrain from the practice. When an outsider introduces the violation, insiders will be more likely to adopt the violation provided they can retain an identity buffer. We posit that when outsiders adopt code-preserving behavior, thus narrowing the identity buffer between insiders and outsiders, it will mitigate insiders’ likelihood of code violation adoption.

This, in turn, leads to lower store-level service quality and sales. This effect is independent of the notion suggested in earlier studies that temp workers threaten the job security and opportunities for advancement of regular employees.

Previous research has focused on how routine participants bring particular intentions to the performance of a routine and choose the means for accomplishing the pre-defined ends accordingly. Drawing on the pragmatist theory of action and a yearlong ethnographic study of a pharmaceutical company, we uncover “emerging intentionality” in routine performances. We show how the foregrounding of means within the concrete situation at hand might lead to the emergence of new ends to pursue. Moreover, we find that the emergence of new ends in routine performances might result in updating the goals for the routine and its associated patterns. With these findings, we contribute to a better understanding of the full spectrum of intentional action in routine dynamics, ranging from purposeful action (foregrounding ends) to purposive action (foregrounding means). This expanded perspective on intentionality in routine dynamics suggests a greater potential for continuous routine change than previous research has acknowledged.",ok

To examine this transformation in pay-setting, we studied a U.S. company that introduced a living wage for its low-wage workers. Interviews with 64 participants across two sites revealed both intended and unintended effects. Motivated by humanistic aims, the living wage was designed to reduce financial insecurity; indeed, workers felt more financially secure and fulfilled in their personal lives. However, its humanistic intent conflicted with the dominant market-based ideology linking wages to performance, raising concerns about whether these workers deserved higher pay. To resolve this tension, managers and workers altered expectations for workers to reflect two aspects of professional-class roles: autonomy and overwork. As workers internalized these expectations, they adopted elements of professional-class identities while remaining in working-class jobs. Simultaneously, managers reaffirmed their own role identities as shapers of performance despite their weakened control over wages. These findings inform a multilevel model conceptualizing how a transformative humanistic practice can be subordinated to market-based ideology through identity work. We contribute to research on humanistic management and the interconnections between wage, class, work roles, and identity.",ok

An innovator learns by being imitated—observing the imitator’s choices and outcomes and comparing them to its own. A key challenge in such learning, and in vicarious learning more broadly, is causal ambiguity in identifying the factors that drive observed performance outcomes. We theorize that an innovator’s learning by being imitated is particularly effective in overcoming causal ambiguity when it takes the form of vicarious experimentation, where an imitator’s near-clone of the innovator’s product functions as a quasi-experimental treatment from which the innovator can learn. This concept extends the logic of strategic experimentation by highlighting how firms can learn from experiments they do not control. We test our theory in the video game industry, demonstrating that vicarious experimentation enhances the quality of the innovator’s next-generation product and offering support for the theorized boundary conditions under which this effect holds.",ok

Existing theoretical perspectives on status quo deviations have not sufficiently addressed how managers order the firm’s essential activities that differ primarily in terms of the scrutiny those activities engender. Drawing from concepts in the accounting and political science literatures, we advance a “scrutiny-bundling” perspective that suggests that firms engage in scrutiny-hazarding action in the wake of social disapproval, assessed in this study via negative media coverage. We further theorize that a strong linkage between the focus of media coverage and the specific scrutiny-hazarding action exacerbates this relationship. We then contend that managers at firms that are either large in size or that perform well relative to their aspirations are less sensitive to social disapproval, and are therefore less likely to engage in scrutiny bundling.

We test our conceptual model by examining the effects of the frequently criticized benefit corporation legislation passed in 36 U.S. jurisdictions on the related B Corporation certification. We find that new certifications and recertifications both increase in jurisdictions with such legislation and these effects are amplified or attenuated depending on corporate sustainability norms in the region. Taken together, our findings contribute to the intensifying societal conversation regarding the prospects for remaking capitalism, illustrating how even weak legislation can contribute to systems change not only by encouraging incremental sustainability reforms within a field but also by triggering an authentication imperative that mobilizes values-driven businesses to pursue rigorous certifications.",ok

We analyze how growing socioeconomic pressures that aim to redress the longstanding underrepresentation of female and ethnic minority directors may lessen, for these sought-after directors, the penalties typically imposed by the labor market in the aftermath of corporate misconduct.

In this article, however, we consider how family may enhance work even when family experiences are not explicitly positive. We draw on boundary theory and cognitive psychology’s current concerns theory to evaluate how employees’ family structures and associated after-work activities affect their work absorption. A survey of business school alumni (Study 1) revealed that single, childless workers reported lower absorption than workers with other family structures. Further, a daily diary study of university employees (Study 2) showed that employees’ planned after-work activities explained the relationship between family structure and work absorption. Specifically, single, childless workers anticipated fewer domestic after-work activities, resulting in lower work absorption. Due to similarities between domestic responsibilities and work tasks—for example, their obligatory and goal-directed nature—anticipating domestic responsibilities after work reinforces, rather than distracts from, the work mindset, thus keeping employees more immersed psychologically in their work. This finding suggests that having a spouse and/or children can affect employees’ work absorption positively through the anticipation of domestic duties after work. Thus, our study contributes to a more comprehensive view of how employees’ work and nonwork lives are connected.",ok

Nevertheless, as work systems designed to direct action with a heavy hand are increasingly implemented in organizations, the disconnect between formal delineations and situated practice is transformed with large negative consequences for organizations. Through 16 months of empirical research using ethnographic methods surrounding implementation of an electronic health records (EHR) system in a hospital obstetric unit, we find that the EHR rendered what was once a productive disconnect between formal logics and situated practice into an unproductive disconnect. Further, this shift engendered a new form of ongoing coordinating. What was once “artful coordinating”—in which clinicians across occupations drew upon formal logics, local context, and situated contingencies as resources to action and, in so doing, created conditions of predictability and informal accountability—became “contorted coordinating,” characterized by working around formal logics of the EHR while struggling to meet the demands of local context and situated contingencies, thus undermining predictability.",ok

We tested our hypotheses using two studies: an archival study of 5,676 movies in the U.S. film industry and a complementary experiment. Results suggest that late handoffs yielded less creative final products than no or early handoffs, meaning it was costly to creativity when employees implemented relatively mature ideas without driving at least some of their prior development. However, “serialized late handoffs”—wherein implementers were handed relatively mature ideas after an earlier handoff between two other individuals—were less costly to creativity than late handoffs from one other individual. Mediation results suggest that late handoffs reduced implementers’ creativity by restricting their sense of psychological ownership and the coherence of their final products.

We find support for this model in a series of lab experiments which show that (a) experts are more likely than novices to double down and produce overly precise predictions following disconfirming feedback, (b) this feedback-induced overprecision by experts is mediated by perceived level of expert identity threat, (c) the source of the feedback matters for identity threat and overprecision, and (d) self-affirmation attenuates identity threat and reduces overprecision. We supplement these experimental findings by investigating experts’ response to disconfirming feedback in two real-world settings: Major League Baseball umpiring and chief financial officer predictions of stock market returns.

Drawing from the theory of political ideology as motivated cognition, across multiple pre-registered field studies we found that employees who were more liberal-leaning (vs. conservative-leaning) reported higher engagement in all three modalities. We also examined whether contextual affordances amplified the liberalism effect. Specifically, we tested whether personal accountability for diversity, colleague diversity, and organizational ideology directed liberals toward greater engagement in self, relational, and organizational work, respectively. As hypothesized, more liberal-leaning employees reported higher engagement in organizational ally work in more ideologically liberal organizations. However, the hypothesized effects of personal accountability were not supported. Notably, personal accountability had a positive effect on self ally work among more conservative-leaning employees. The moderating effects of colleague diversity were also mixed across studies.

We then offer a novel, stakeholder-centric theoretical perspective, conjecturing that stakeholders’ negative sentiment toward the CEO appointment undermines post-succession performance. We further conjecture that outside CEOs are less effective in leveraging their executive experience and suffer more from negative transfer and negative sentiment when compared to inside CEOs, who can leverage their familiarity and social embeddedness in the firm, which explains why outside CEOs may underperform. Analyzing the appointments of CEOs in U.S. public firms, we find that counter to expectations, the length and breadth of their executive experience do not explain either post-succession performance or the performance differences between outside CEOs and inside CEOs. Rather, the misfit between CEOs’ corporate backgrounds and their firms’ characteristics and the negative sentiment surrounding their appointments explain performance differences and the underperformance of outside CEOs.

Drawing from the innovation collaboration literature, and qualitative insights from interviews and contracts, we argue that collaboration risk impairs task performance of public–private versus private–private collaboration. We attribute this to two collaboration risk mechanisms: cooperation problems arising from misaligned social versus economic incentives, and coordination problems due to differences in organizational governance and processes. We test our hypotheses using the development history of 2,496 antimicrobial drugs from 1995–2019. After accounting for endogenous selection into collaboration, we find that public–private collaboration is less effective than private–private collaboration. However, this performance gap reduces for innovation tasks under high technological uncertainty (i.e., in the discovery stage and for developing new drug action mechanisms). To probe the distinctive cooperation and coordination mechanisms, we also examine innovation task efficiency. Findings reveal a wider gap in task effectiveness but not efficiency between public–private and private–private collaboration, suggesting more significant cooperation than coordination problems. Our theoretical and practical insights pertain to whether, when, and how public–private and private–private collaboration offer viable pathways for socially beneficial innovation tasks.",ok

Decision makers perceive candidates that have a greater ability required for the task as less (more) instrumental to their personal outcomes if they expect to compete (cooperate) with the candidate, and they discriminate in favor of candidates that are perceived as more instrumental to them. We tested our theory in the context of racial (Studies 1–3) and age (Study 4) discrimination in selection decisions with all-male samples and found evidence consistent with our predictions. By explaining when and why decision makers discriminate in favor of, but also against, members of their own social group, this research may help to explain the mixed support for the dominant view that decision makers exhibit favoritism toward candidates that belong to the same social group.

Yet, employees will benefit only when these opportunities arise as a result of their own collaborators leaving—that is, employees must lose to gain. Using longitudinal data on employees within a single research organization, I show that collaborator exits increase the likelihood of employees’ competency-driven promotion in a way that noncollaborator exits do not.

While the dominant explanations for this link involve physiology and cognitive resources, we offer a different perspective. We suggest that dreams, or psychological experiences during sleep, spill over to affect employee behavior. This spillover effect, we argue, results from the interplay between dreaming, meaning creation, and emotion. Taking a morning-of perspective, we theorize that recalling and ascribing meaning to dream experiences elicits awe—an epistemic emotion produced by appraisals of vastness and a need for cognitive accommodation. In turn, because awe reduces individuals’ focus on themselves and their concerns, we argue that experiencing awe upon awakening increases employee resilience, and ultimately goal progress, throughout the workday. However, because awe entails a felt need to expand one’s existing ways of knowing, employees may vary in their receptivity to awe. We therefore argue that the link between awe and resilience hinges on trait epistemic curiosity, or employees’ inherent desire to seek and acquire new knowledge. Across three studies—including a morning-of field study, a single-day morning–afternoon study, and a two-week experience sampling study—we find that ascribing positive meaning to dreams elicits awe, which in turn promotes resilience, and ultimately goal progress, throughout the workday.",ok

We theorize the construction of market-protected spaces as a multilevel mechanism for institutionalizing an emerging logic in the context of a field dominated by the market logic via three forms of institutional work: restraining the jurisdiction of the market logic, infusing the responsible management logic with nonmarket elements, and maintaining market-protected spaces against resistance. A “market-protected space” is an institutionally bound space that suspends the dominance of the market logic on selected issues based on a binding institutional infrastructure that allows prioritizing responsible management—unlike voluntary CSR, which still prioritizes the market logic.

Given the inherent uncertainty surrounding a decision to invest in these ventures, prior research has found that experienced investors rely heavily on their investor gut feel—that is, dynamic expertise-based emotion-cognitions specific to the entrepreneurship context. In this paper, I inductively find that rather than being based on rapid, nonconscious impulse, as much of prior literature would suggest, what investors call their “gut feel” is an elaborate “intuiting process.” This process serves a distinct purpose: it emboldens investors to make investments that would otherwise be considered overly risky and likely to lead to failure. In the theoretical model I present, I delineate how investors are guided by a predisposed stance on risk and uncertainty, which dictates the approach investors take toward managing the complexity of an investment opportunity—and how they cognitively and emotionally reframe investment risk into a compelling narrative that transcends avoidance behavior and leads investors to invest.

However, in many cases the ethnic community influences the investment choice of the same firm in one location but not another. We offer an institutional lens to explain this heterogeneity. Ethnic groups function like informal institutions that facilitate transactions between foreign firms and customers, suppliers, and information providers through interpersonal exchange. Relying on ethnic communities to mediate transactions in foreign markets is valuable but limited by the relatively small scale of these communities. In contrast, relying on formal institutions allows firms to expand more broadly into foreign markets because the impersonal exchange inherent in formal governance is more scalable. This is manifested in “dual entry strategies” wherein ethnic communities have a significantly stronger influence on location choice in places with unreliable (weak and unstable) formal institutions than in places with reliable formal institutions. We found support for these ideas using a unique dataset of South Korean banks’ investments in Chinese provinces during 1992–2013. To mitigate endogeneity concerns, we exploited a historical migration that created a quasi-random distribution of ethnic Koreans across provinces.

We theorize and find—across two studies centered upon various mega-threats, including a mass shooting targeting Asian Americans and police killings of Black civilians—that event observers who share identities with mega-threat victims become vicarious victims, which triggers an experience of “embodied threat,” an appraisal of the increased likelihood of personally encountering identity-based harm. The experience of embodied threat coupled with the racialized nature of organizational structures, which limits the agency of racial minorities, then compels employees to engage in threat suppression. Furthermore, we find that threat suppression consumes psychological resources, leading to heightened avoidant work behaviors, or higher work withdrawal and lower social engagement, but, when the psychological safety of identity-based discussions is high, it attenuates this effect. Altogether, our paper advances research on mega-threats and race in organizations, and yields practical insights that can assist managers in reducing the detrimental effects of mega-threats on employees.",ok

We claim that the ongoing activities of the place, and the periodic ones of the event, are mutually reinforcing.

Our theory is grounded in the notion that, when used jointly, these organizational resources maximize each of the three underlying psychological conditions necessary for full engagement; namely, psychological meaningfulness, safety, and availability. The resource management model also underscores the value of top management team members implementing and monitoring progress on the firm's strategy as a means to enhance the effects of organizational resources on collective organizational engagement. We empirically test this theory in a sample of 83 firms, and provide evidence that collective organizational engagement mediates the relationship between the three organizational resources and firm performance.

When fields mobilize for a grand challenge, what inhibits them from realizing their intended ambitions? This is a critical question not only for grand challenges, but also for institutional theory, which tends to focus on field mobilization rather than on how goals are pursued over time. Field scholars often assume stable participants with goals that easily translate into actions, but fields are dynamic and unlikely to comply with these assumptions. With a longitudinal, multimethod study of the nanotechnology field, we examined how five communities mobilized and pursued the grand challenge of creating molecular manufacturing from 1986 to 2005. We identify a key duality of mobilization: the very strategies employed to successfully mobilize diverse participants to support the grand challenge actually helped displace it with less ambitious goals.

Prior research on joint search highlights the role of specialized organizations, mainly regarding technological domains, to identify a superior solution. However, stakeholder theory leads us to believe that the success of any solution depends on the acceptance and support of important stakeholders. In this study, we suggest that search consortia are more likely to receive funding when they include representatives of stakeholder concerns, so-called advocacy groups. We extend theory on coordinated exploration in joint search by integrating mechanisms from stakeholder theory and argue that advocacy groups improve the generation of potential solutions and provide legitimacy. We test our theory with a unique dataset of 35,249 consortia that proposed solutions to 2,349 grand challenge problems as part of a large European funding program. Our results show that advocacy groups benefit search consortia, particularly when consortia exhibit a high dispersion of technological knowledge and when they are inexperienced.",ok

The belief that actual FSHC constrains mobility undergirds its critical role in resource-based theory. However, this rests on a strong assumption of information efficiency that market actors correctly assess how specific an individual’s skills are, and price it appropriately. Emerging theoretical viewpoints dispute this, pointing out labor market imperfections and substantial difficulty in observing FSHC. We therefore develop theory about how perceived FSHC may relate positively to mobility by articulating a role for well-known supply-side mechanisms such as job satisfaction, embeddedness, and preference for job autonomy. Using two archival surveys and two primary surveys collected in very different contexts (South Korea and the United States), we found support for our theory. Perceptions of FSHC were associated with increased mobility and this effect was partially mediated by job satisfaction and job embeddedness. The effect was augmented for workers who value autonomy in their jobs (and who are more likely to exit if they perceived their skills as FSHC). Since the effect of perceived FSHC is quite different from that of extant theory which focused on actual FSHC, we explore implications for resource-based and human capital theories.",ok

Drawing on relational self and self-affirmation theory, we argue that affirmation of team members’ social worth by trusted people outside the team helps them internalize an identity as a valued contributor, thereby reducing social acceptance concerns and facilitating information sharing in teams. We devised three intervention studies to demonstrate the causal effect of social worth affirmation in teams. In Study 1, senior executive teams in which members experienced social worth affirmation performed better (compared to control teams) on a crisis simulation that required information sharing in teams. In Study 2, with U.S. military cadets, we examined social acceptance concerns as a mechanism by which social worth affirmation influences information sharing. In Study 3, we showed that social worth affirmation improves virtual teams’ ability to share information by exchanging unique information cues. Our results suggest that affirmation of the social worth of team members through their personal relationships broadens their sense of self, thereby reducing their social concerns about being accepted by other members. This, in turn, leads to better information sharing in teams.",ok

In this article, we draw from self-determination and moral licensing theories to suggest a potential negative consequence of OCB. Specifically, we argue that when employees feel compelled to engage in OCB by external forces, they will subsequently feel psychologically entitled for having gone above and beyond the call of duty. Furthermore, these feelings of entitlement can act as moral credentials that psychologically free employees to engage in both interpersonal and organizational deviance. Data from two multisource field studies and an online experiment provide support for these hypotheses. In addition, we demonstrate that OCB-generated feelings of entitlement transcend organizational boundaries and lead to deviance outside of the organization.",ok

We engage in three studies to explore what individuals speak up about, why they speak up about those things, and the consequences of voicing such content. First, through a qualitative field study, we find evidence for three dimensions of voice content: the importance of initiating change, the required resources to enact the desired change, and the interdependencies involved in implementing the desired change. Further, specific targets of identification—either one’s local work unit or one’s broader profession—shape whether the issues individuals raise take into account barriers related to resources and interdependencies. Next, in a quantitative field study, we find that voicing on issues related to one’s work unit or profession mediates the relationship between employee identification and managers’ valuation of voice. Finally, in an experiment, we manipulate importance, resources, and interdependencies of implementation and find these dimensions of voice content influence managerial value of voice.

Using a novel dataset of power plants across China, I find that the theorized intermediation mechanisms and the ways in which firms assess them are partially bounded by institutional complexities. Firms’ inexperience with regulations and their adoption of novel technologies are positively related to those firms’ selection of public intermediaries, with the former relationship strengthened when regulatory changes suggest a continuous need for policy updating. Meanwhile, firms’ noncompliance records and a lack of institutional linkage to the government are positively related to their reliance on private intermediaries’ buffering competency, with the latter relationship evident only in settings with an interventionist government. These findings contribute to the literature on the complex and dynamic value of intermediaries and firms’ intermediary choices at the intersection of management and government.",ok

We draw on conservation of resources theory to examine the resource-generating power of two distinct expressions of compassion (self- and other-directed) on three dimensions of burnout (exhaustion, cynicism, inefficacy). Utilizing two complementary designs—a longitudinal field survey of 130 social service providers and an experiential sampling methodology with 100 business students across 10 days—we find a complex pattern of results indicating that both compassion expressions have the potential to generate salutogenic resources (self-control, belonging, self-esteem) that replenish different dimensions of burnout. Specifically, self-compassion remedies exhaustion and other-compassion remedies cynicism—directly or indirectly through resources—while the effects of self- and other-compassion on inefficacy vary. Our key takeaway is that compassion can indeed contribute to human sustainability in organizations, but only when the type of compassion provided generates resources that fit the idiosyncratic experience of burnout.",ok

We argue that both social imprinting, defined as a founding team’s early emphasis on accomplishing the organization’s social mission, and economic productivity are important drivers of a WISE’s social performance. However, there is a paradox inherent in the social imprinting of WISEs: Although social imprinting directly enhances a WISE’s social performance, social imprinting also indirectly weakens social performance by negatively affecting economic productivity. Results based on panel data of French WISEs gathered between 2003 and 2007 are congruent with our predictions. To understand how socially imprinted WISEs may mitigate this negative relationship between social imprinting and economic productivity, we also conduct a comparative analysis of case studies. We find that one effective approach is to assign responsibility for social and economic activities to distinct groups while creating “spaces of negotiation”—arenas of interaction that allow members of each group to discuss the trade-offs that they face. We conclude by highlighting the conditions under which spaces of negotiation can effectively be used to maintain a productive tension in hybrid organizations.",ok

By contrast, mixed-gender coalitions signal both forms of legitimacy, and are thus uniquely effective. We demonstrate these effects over three studies: managers reporting on advocacy coalitions comprising their colleagues (Study 1), an audio-based study showing that the proposed effects are unique for gender equity issues (Study 2), and a stimulus sampling study involving multiple policy proposals (Study 3).

In this study, we argue that decoupling occurs within regulatory agencies and results from a combination of conflicting institutional pressures, complex goals, and internal fragmentation. Further, regulatory decoupling is selective—that is, regulators fail to adequately enforce standards only for one set of organizations. Regulated organizations that benefit from selective regulatory decoupling use nonmarket strategies to maintain their favorable regulatory status, and, in the process, selectively decouple their norms in one organizational activity but not others. As an empirical context, we use the hospital industry in which regulators have to balance conflicting pressures to be tough on fraud while maintaining the community’s access to essential but unprofitable services, such as charity care and medical education. In response, hospital regulators selectively decouple and exhibit leniency in enforcement of mispricing practices toward “beneficent hospitals,” defined as hospitals that provide more charity care and medical education. In turn, beneficent hospitals selectively decouple their service and profit goals by providing unprofitable services to uninsured patients, while mispricing insured patients to earn higher reimbursements.",ok

As a result of the interlock, the firm is more likely to gain access to the counterpart firm’s knowledge resources through research and development alliances and forestall litigation barriers in the use of core technologies.

We build new theory on why justice social comparison perceptions influence employee behavior (specifically, helping and instigated incivility) by viewing the phenomenon through a self-regulatory lens. Doing so enables us to identify a novel explanatory mechanism and boundary condition for these effects. In two experience sampling studies, each conducted over multiple weeks, we test our proposed mechanism—envy and self-regulatory resource depletion—against four alternative justice-based mechanisms derived from equity theory, the group engagement model, social exchange theory, and referent cognitions theory. Findings were consistent with our theorizing, verifying that our integration of self-regulation with social comparison processes offers new insights to the justice literature.

Analysis of data involving 544 individuals in 78 units, collected from multiple sources over three different time periods, revealed that unit empowerment evidenced a synergistic interaction with individual-level psychological empowerment as related to individuals’ job performance, as well as an indirect effect on performance via individual empowerment, while controlling for previous performance levels. Notably, these effects were significant at relatively high, but not at relatively low, levels of unit empowerment. Furthermore, we found that unit voice climate increased unit empowerment and thereby enhanced individual psychological empowerment.

Therefore, such surprises are positively associated with the intensity of competitive actions initiated by a focal firm. Furthermore, the complexity and vagueness of a rival’s language in an earnings conference call strengthens the positive relationship between the negative earnings surprise and the focal firm’s intensity of competitive actions. We tested our arguments using data from 3,202 earnings releases and conferences calls of publicly listed firms between 2003 and 2014 in the United States.

We explore how local organizational agents and contexts enable women leaders to overcome these barriers and achieve success at the highest levels in firms. Specifically, we focus on chief executive officer (CEO) succession events and study how several facets of predecessor CEOs and the succession context combine to influence incoming women’s post-succession performance. We conduct a qualitative comparative case study of all CEO successions that involved female successors between 1989 and 2009 across the largest corporations in the United States. Our findings suggest that women’s success occurred when a confluence of local firm-level factors and attributes of the (mostly) male predecessors promoted gender-inclusive gatekeeping during succession. Our qualitative comparative analysis approach reveal three recipes for female success: “handing over the legacy,” “partnering the legacy,” and “turning around the legacy.” Moreover, a comparison to a matched-sample of men CEO succession events shows that these three recipes for success are unique to women. Based upon our findings, we propose that male predecessors’ gender-inclusive gatekeeping facilitates female leaders’ success and occurs when local enabling conditions and the embedded context enact agentic and structural mechanisms to alter leadership schemas.",ok

Moreover, we find that the moderating effect of financial slack on HR slack in the strategic change context operates through changes in organizations’ human capital investment, offering a unique examination of a key mechanism through which slack resources create value and through which complementarities between different types of slack come to fruition.

We propose a two-stage theoretical model—first, a lead firm is selected to lead the alliance; second, the lead firm selects other partners—and we argue that political risk affects both stages. In the first stage, firms with knowledge of and influence in the project country are selected to lead projects in countries with high political risk. In the second stage, the lead firm selects a group of partners with knowledge and influence to ensure that the alliance—as a whole—has the resources needed in such countries. We also show, as a corollary, that the imperative to find these resources drives the lead firm to work with more-diverse multipartner alliances despite the higher coordination costs involved. We test our hypotheses by analyzing, first, the selection of the lead firm in 1,044 multipartner banking syndicates that financed some of the world’s largest infrastructure projects in 68 countries between 2003 and 2012. Controlling for the lead firm, we then examine how political risk affects the selection of other partners in the multipartner alliance by comparing the realized syndicates with over 33,000 counterfactual (unrealized) multipartner syndicates.",ok

We integrate this theory with social information processing theory to develop hypotheses about the effects of a leader’s sense of humor on follower behavior. We suggest that although a leader’s sense of humor is positively associated with leader−member exchange and ultimately work engagement, it can also signal to followers the acceptability of norm violation at work. These perceptions in turn are positively associated with followers’ deviance. Furthermore, we propose that these indirect effects are moderated by leader aggressive humor. Data from two three-wave field studies in China and the United States provide support for our hypotheses. Taken together, our results suggest that a leader’s sense of humor can be a mixed blessing and elicit unforeseen negative behaviors from their followers.",ok

Within this self-control framework, poor performance is more likely to lead to abusive supervision when (a) the magnitude of the hostility experienced is higher (e.g., for those with a hostile attribution bias), or (b) the translation of hostility into abusive supervision is unconstrained (e.g., for those who are low in trait mindfulness). In two experimental studies with full-time supervisors where we manipulated the independent variable (Study 1) and the mediator (Study 2), and in a multi-wave and multi-source field study with data collected from supervisor–subordinate teams (50 supervisors and 206 subordinates) at two time points (Study 3), we found overall support for our predictions.

Our study challenges that consensus by arguing that feeling trusted can be exhausting for employees. Drawing on Stevan Hobfoll’s conservation of resources theory, we develop a model in which feeling trusted fills an employee with pride—a benefit for exhaustion and performance—while also increasing perceived workload and concerns about reputation maintenance—burdens for exhaustion and performance. We test our model in a field study using a sample of public transit bus drivers in London, England. Our results suggest that feeling trusted is a double-edged sword for job performance, bringing with it both benefits and burdens.

We further investigate two contingencies—namely, the structural holes the focal firm spans and the geographic concentration of its inventive activities—that moderate the detrimental innovation effects of ego network stability. Focal firms can limit the negative effects of ego-network stability on innovation by spanning structural holes in their alliance portfolios, whereas the negative effects are worsened when the focal firms’ inventive activities are geographically concentrated in a single country.

Addressing these limitations, we developed and tested a theoretical model of relational attachment at work using a complementary fit perspective. After validating measures, we tested, extended, and replicated our model in three field studies. Results revealed that employees became more attached to their organization and experienced more beneficial outcomes when they had stronger psychological attachment to others at work. This relational attachment was not driven by general social support, but, rather, by “relational needs fit,” which reflects employees’ experience of having their needs met by their work relationships. However, receiving more personal support than what was wanted or needed intruded into employees’ privacy boundaries and created a “too close for comfort” reaction whereby they pulled back from their work relationships. This “too much of a good thing” finding indicates that, while positive relationships at work are effective, social support should be tailored to individuals’ needs.",ok

While these events bear an intuitive connection to corporate reputation, several scholars have raised questions about the role of discrete exchanges in overall evaluations of firms. Additionally, scholars have neither systematically examined such effects nor elaborated a formal theory thereof. The present paper fills this gap by developing and testing a middle range theory of this important yet poorly understood relationship. This theory identifies the psychological mechanism (trait attribution) which underlies this relationship and explains how discrete, stakeholder-specific exchange failures can damage reputations of larger corporate entities. It also explains how social and historical information associated with failed exchanges can affect this process. We elaborate and test this theory through a study of the effects of quarterly earnings misses on firms’ standing in the Fortune “Most Admired Company” survey. Consistent with our theory, earnings misses did damage firm standing. However, misses did not invariably produce reputational damage and, as predicted, their effects were contingent on associated social (e.g., peer firm reliability, institutional context) and historical (e.g., the firm’s track record and statements) information.",ok

This competition for resources is also present when a high density of elite-oriented nonprofits operates in the same community. Hypotheses focused on the institutional dimension receive mixed support. As predicted, welfare nonprofits are more effective when they operate in communities with strong law enforcement capabilities and less effective in politically conservative local contexts. Contrary to our expectations, however, we find that welfare nonprofits are less effective in demographically heterogeneous local contexts and when the government provides effective social policies, thus indicating a possible substitution effect. Surprisingly, nonprofit effectiveness is increased in highly financialized local contexts.

Moreover, these effects were stronger when the level of prosocial climate for newcomers was high.

Consistent with this argument, we document a negative relationship between stakeholder orientation and divestiture activity, using a unique dataset of 909 U.S.-based, publicly listed firms from 2002 to 2015. This negative relationship is more pronounced for selloffs than for spinoffs, for selloffs of businesses that are unrelated to or located far from the divesting firm, and for selloffs to acquirers that are not alliance partners of divesting firms.

Stigmatizers strategically employed two types of analogy: “deep” and “surface.” Deep analogies produce emotive power, facilitating the moralization of the ingroup through the transfer of affective meanings from a source context to a target domain. Surface analogies generate causal power to inform wider audiences of the target’s deviance through association with already-stigmatized organizational categories.

Specifically, we propose that PFP has a conditional positive effect (i.e., in the context of high performance subjectivity) on employee helping behavior, and further theorize and test the underlying psychological mechanism by which individual perceived helping–performance expectancy accounts for the interactive effects between PFP and performance subjectivity on employee helping behavior. The empirical results of three studies employing distinctive methodologies provide general support for our hypotheses.

Using dual formation strategies from the onset fosters the development of stronger transactive memory systems, because close relationships facilitate smooth coordination among founders specializing in complementary tasks. Transactive memory systems thus mediate the relationship between formation strategies and early entrepreneurial success. Findings from two field observational studies and a field intervention study support our theory: teams formed based on a dual strategy raised greater seed funding on Kickstarter—a leading crowdfunding platform—(Study 1), were more successful in a prestigious entrepreneurial competition (Study 2), and gained more profits from selling their initial products (Study 3).

Other material endowments, such as key people and architectural design, were used to reinforce the integrity of authenticity claims. Our study extends our understanding of authenticity as a valued organizational resource. First, we identify two mechanisms, anchoring and reinforcement, through which materiality both constrains and facilitates organizations’ authenticity narratives. Second, our research brings to the fore how audience members’ experiential closeness to producers colors their perceptions of authenticity, and we show how material artifacts can enhance such closeness. Third, our findings highlight the competitive value of authenticity by unpacking how producers’ material endowments may constitute a resource or a liability.",ok

To explain the performance implications of employee mobility, the literature has focused on what moving individuals can do, but has ignored what they are willing to do. However, to fully understand what individuals will actually do at the new firm, we need to understand both. We argue that what individuals are willing to do depends on their collective and relational identity. When competing against a former employer, individuals experience a conflict in their collective identity as they identify with both organizations but can only increase the welfare of one. To reduce this conflict, individuals strengthen their identification with the new organization and deidentify with the former by competing harder against the former organization. At the relational level, individuals can still identify with their ex-colleagues without harming the welfare of the new organization by competing harder with non-former colleagues but behaving less competitively toward former colleagues.

This phenomenon has been linked to direct benefits to entrepreneurial firms, offering valuable knowledge and routines obtained by employees during their tenure at incumbent firms. We propose a theoretical framework in which shared experience—a common background in beneficial knowledge management practices—creates a “cohort effect,” facilitating direct ties and innovation benefits to new ventures receiving inventors from the same incumbent firms. Analyzing longitudinal data on inventor migration to 658 new biotech ventures tracked from 1990 to 2013, we find shared migration ties increase knowledge and market overlap between firms, enhancing their likelihood of direct engagement through alliances and employee hiring as well as the quality of knowledge they develop. Our core theoretical contribution is the identification of a migration cohort effect, in which inventors who share contemporaneous experiences at incumbent firms and migrate to new ventures create unique relationships between those ventures. Where prior research on spawning and migration has focused primarily on the direct benefit of human capital transfer from incumbents to new ventures, we explore the broader network implications of similarities and interactions between firms receiving this human capital.",ok

Using a sample of active-duty military men and women, we employed live observation techniques to study voice enactment in all-male teams versus female-token teams (i.e., teams with a token female member) throughout a series of complex and physically demanding tasks. Our findings revealed that (a) token female voice enactment was higher when team leaders possessed more favorable beliefs about women’s capabilities in the military, and (b) token female voice enactment enhanced team performance in more complex tasks but harmed team performance in less complex tasks.

However, evidence supporting the relation of ostracism and self-esteem level to behavioral outcomes has been mixed. We argue that such mixed effects arise because individuals may engage in behaviors alternately to verify their self-perceptions (suggesting a relation between self-esteem level and behavioral outcomes) or to self-enhance (suggesting no relation between self-esteem level and behavioral outcomes). Within this framing, the question becomes: When do we self-verify and when do we self-enhance? To that end, we position contingent self-esteem—or the extent to which individuals base their self-worth on outcomes in a particular domain—as a determining factor in whether we self-verify or self-enhance, and present a moderated mediation model to account for varying relations between ostracism and job performance. Our predictions regarding self-verification and self-enhancement motivation are fully supported across two field samples using multi-wave, multi-source study designs.

In this study, I adapt these theories to posit that organizations establish close collaborative relationships with regulatory agents to overcome uncertainty following enforcement actions, and I ascertain that such collaborations can enhance organizational compliance with enforced mandates. However, I also find that organizations with the least visible practices will go “under the radar,” foregoing such collaborations because of the risks associated with disclosing private information to regulators. Thus, paradoxically, those organizations that could arguably learn or change the most through these exchanges in fact eschew them. This study and its findings deepen our understanding regarding organizational compliance with external pressures, emphasize the role of organizational visibility in interactions with outside agents, and contribute to the literatures on organizational search and learning by examining a reciprocal learning process.",ok

We also explore the psychological underpinnings of rivalry in order to illuminate how it differs from general competition and why it increases unethical behavior. The data reveal a serial mediation pathway whereby rivalry heightens the psychological stakes of competition (by increasing actors’ contingency of self-worth and status concerns), which leads to the adoption of a stronger performance-approach orientation, which then increases unethical behavior. These findings highlight the importance of rivalry as a widespread, powerful, yet largely unstudied phenomenon with significant organizational implications. They also help to inform when and why unethical behavior occurs within organizations, and demonstrate that the effects of competition are dependent upon relationships and prior interactions between actors.",ok

Results from a comprehensive panel of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs), using fixed effects and system general method of moments (GMM) models to correct for endogeneity issues, show that inherited parent firm knowledge is not equally valuable in all countries. The transfer of technological knowledge is value-creating when home country innovation dominates and when parent firm knowledge is transferred to foreign operations in lagging technology countries (when foreign technology dominates). Further, combining managerial knowledge transfers with local subsidiary investments in innovation is shown to boost the performance of foreign operations located in leading technology countries, suggesting that the prior experiences, connections, and knowledge of expatriate managers, can be particularly useful in managing new knowledge generated in these countries. Overall, this paper extends our understanding of knowledge management within MNCs by exploring when transfers of parent technological and managerial knowledge are more likely to improve the performance of foreign operations in increasingly globally competitive industries.",ok

By collecting data of 640 daily interactions from both sides of 85 leader–employee dyads using the experience sampling method through mobile surveys, we found that leaders’ positive affect was positively related to employees’ voice behavior. Furthermore, such a relationship could be accounted for through employees’ psychological safety directly via the emotional contagion mechanism (through employees’ own positive affect) but not directly via the signaling mechanism (through employees’ assessment of leaders’ positive affect); and the effects of both employees’ own positive affect and their assessments of leaders’ positive affect on psychological safety were stronger when the leader–member exchange relationship was weak. Interestingly, we also found that leaders’ negative affect was positively related to employees’ voice, but neither emotional contagion nor signaling mechanisms explained this effect.

We expand research on regulatory focus theory by testing whether chief executive officers’ (CEOs’) regulatory focus impacts the proclivity of firms to undertake acquisitions. Furthermore, regulatory focus theory suggests that the effects of people’s promotion and prevention foci are magnified when their regulatory focus is congruent with salient situational characteristics, a phenomenon known as regulatory fit. As a test of this idea, we demonstrate how the effects of CEO promotion and prevention foci are differentially impacted by one such characteristic, namely incentive compensation. Our findings indicate that CEO regulatory focus impacts both the quantity and scale of acquisitions undertaken by a firm.

We return to the roots of LMX and utilize role theory to argue that agreement between leader and subordinate perceptions of LMX quality has meaningful effects on employee motivation and behavior. In a polynomial regression analysis of 280 leader–subordinate dyads, employee work engagement—and subsequent organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)—was maximized (at each level of LMX quality) when leaders and subordinates were in agreement about the quality of their LMX relationship, but suffered when they did not see “eye to eye.” Indeed, situations in which both leaders and subordinates evaluated their relationship as low quality were associated with higher work engagement (and subsequent OCB) than were situations of disagreement in which a single member evaluated the relationship as high quality. Further, this effect was consistent regardless of whether the leader or the subordinate evaluated the relationship highly. We conclude that, to fully understand the implications of our only dyadic leadership theory, we must consider the perspectives of both members of the LMX dyad simultaneously.",ok

To understand repeated partnerships, we analyze a unique dataset of 580 partnerships that completed 144 bridge construction projects. Controlling for project attributes that affect the level of outsourcing, we posit that a greater proportion of repeated partners and deeper relationships with these partners will result in greater revenue through winning bids, but that the prime contractor will not necessarily garner higher profits.

We suggest that organizations can increase newcomers’ willingness to submit further ideas by providing a thus far understudied form of feedback: rejections. Though counterintuitive, we suggest that rejections encourage newcomers to bond with an organization. Rejections signal contributors that an organization is interested in receiving their ideas and developing relationships with them. To test our theory, we examine the crowdsourcing of 70,159 organizations that received ideas from 1,336,154 contributors. Using text analysis, we examine differences in how rejections are written to disentangle the mechanisms through which rejections affect contributors’ willingness to continue to interact with an organization.

Our findings show that working through these tensions on specific tasks enables actors to legitimate the sustainability strategy in action and to co-enact it with the mainstream strategy within those tasks.

However, we propose that when women engage in lateral role expansion within professional careers, they face a “glass wall”—an invisible barrier that limits their work opportunities due to a gendered evaluation of role expansion. Specifically, role expansion by female (vs. male) freelancers is seen as less agentic, and such difference undermines female freelancers’ perceived competence and commitment. Three studies using different methods (archival data and experiment), industries (music and film), and samples (Korean and American) show that female (vs. male) freelancers who expand into new work roles are seen as less agentic and have less chance of finding new work opportunities.

Our predictions were supported across six experimental studies (Studies 1–4b). Specifically, Black women’s gender and racial discrimination claims were believed less compared to those made by White women and Black men, respectively. Moreover, after they alleged discrimination, Black women received less financial remedy versus White women, but more financial remedy versus Black men.

When a firm ventures beyond these established roles, it often gets punished by its exchange partners. Our interviews in the Champagne grape market, however, suggest that some buyers are penalized more than others in such circumstances. Quantitative analysis confirms that nontraditional buyers receive price penalties for role deviations—through diversification, vertical integration, or disintegration—whereas traditional firms are treated more leniently. A subsequent interpretivist study, using interview data from 78 market participants to explore the exact mechanisms underlying this effect, reveals that sellers blame less traditional buyers when they cross the boundaries of their usual roles because they are thought to act out of volition and bad faith, whereas the same transgressions by more traditional firms are believed to have been necessitated by external circumstances. We conclude that the sanctioning behavior of actors in response to role transgressions by their exchange partners is driven by their interpretation of the motives underlying these transgressions, rather than by the actions themselves. As a result, nontraditional firms may find it difficult to deviate from the traditional roles in their industry.",ok

We focus on three struggles between the Mafia and state representatives, and show how these struggles centered on different types of ambiguity: ambiguity as opacity, equivocality, and absurdity. We elaborate on the strategies enacted by the Mafia and the responses by state representatives and their implications for ambiguity over time. The main contribution of our paper is that it advances understanding of the maintenance of strategic ambiguity by organizations that need to protect themselves from public scrutiny.

Underlying this model is the notion that employees triangulate perceptions of pay secrecy (i.e., a pay-related procedural justice cue that also reflects uncertainty) with their own or others’ perceptions of distributive justice as a basis for assessing organizational trustworthiness, with the latter serving as an important driver of voluntary turnover intentions and behavior. Results of two studies (Study 1 at the individual level and Study 2 at the firm level) indicate that, rather than being universal, the relationship between pay secrecy and turnover is contingent upon perceptions of distributive justice, with turnover intentions (at the individual level via organizational trustworthiness) and voluntary turnover rates (at the firm level) differentially affected by pay secrecy under conditions of higher and lower levels of distributive justice. These findings suggest an important extension to organizational justice theories; namely that, when procedural justice cues are confounded with uncertainty (as they are with pay secrecy), the assumed compounding interaction between procedural and distributive justice cues may be replaced by a more antagonistic interaction.",ok

How might such individuals end up achieving emancipation from an infantilizing identity? To address this puzzle, we conducted a longitudinal study of a German sheltered workshop, an organization providing employment for disabled people. We observed that workers with disability initially maintained a regulating organizational identity based on paternalistic segregation. However, over time, they constructed their own self-determining identity and coproduced a change in the workshop’s identity from “shelter” to “inclusion.” First, we show that in order to coconstruct their preferred self-concept, benevolently marginalized individuals need to gain the support of those in power, who change their role from a guardian to an ally. Second, while achieving liberation from overt marginalization is likely to involve confrontation with one’s oppressors, we suggest that achieving emancipation from benevolent marginalization is a collaborative process of mutual consciousness raising and sensitization.

We propose a theory of individual reputational incentives, which predicts that a firm’s competitive threats decrease its employees’ internal competitive actions yet increase their external competitive actions, while a firm’s competitive opportunities increase employees’ internal and external competitive actions. The theory also predicts that these effects are largest when a firm faces potential unexpected losses or gains in its standing, such as when the firm experiences competitive threats from resource-disadvantaged firms, or competitive opportunities against resource-advantaged firms. In panel data on the population of motorcycle riders competing in MotoGP from 2004 to 2020, we examine these hypotheses using overtakes to measure riders’ internal and external competitive actions.

We apply principles derived from the literature on attribution of motives to research on relational power to delineate a model that explains employees’ moral evaluations of and reactions to referral practices based on the power relationship between a referrer and a hiring manager. Specifically, we predict that employees are more likely to see the acceptance of a referral from a higher- (as opposed to a lower-) power referrer as a way for the hiring manager to gain more power in the relationship with the referrer, thereby attributing more self-interested motives and more counter-organizational motives to the hiring manager in such situations. These motives are then associated with harsher moral judgments of the hiring manager, which in turn lead to less support for the hiring decision. We find support for our model in two experimental studies and two field studies.

This paper shows that the display of moral symbols leads to two main consequences: (1) the activation of the concept of morality and increases in individuals’ moral awareness to decrease unethical behavior, and (2) eliciting inferences about the moral character of the displayer to lower the likelihood of that person being subjected to unethical directives. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that moral symbols influence ethical decisions without provoking hidden backlash effects against those who display them.

This challenge is intensified when dirty work is intractable—when it is difficult, if not impossible, for a person to avoid doing this work. Our study of meaning-making in the face of intractable dirty work examines ragpickers in Mumbai, India, who handle and dispose of garbage, and are further tainted by belonging to the lowest caste in Indian society, and living in slums. These ragpickers constructed both an overarching sense of helplessness rooted in the intractability of their situation, and a set of positive meanings—survival, destiny, and hope—rooted in specific facets of their lives and enacted through distinct temporal frames. By holding and combining these disparate meanings, they achieved “functional ambivalence”—the simultaneous experience of opposing orientations toward their work and lives that facilitated both acceptance and a sense of agency, and enabled them to carry on in their lives.",ok

In an experimental study of individuals conversing with their ties, we provide evidence of the causal effects of weak and strong ties on idea generation and idea elaboration.

Specifically, women are attributed with higher levels of leadership emergence than men when they engage in agentic leadership behaviors—even if the level of the behaviors exhibited by men is exactly the same.

While a linear, clock-time orientation optimized for markets is meant to enhance efficiency, coordination, and control, it may be unsuitable for managing emergent, complex, and indeterminate processes such as development. To examine how the tension between market and development temporalities plays out at the organizational level, we draw on an ethnography of Fairtrade International, an organization connecting markets in the North with low-income community development in the South. We examine intra-organizational contestation over different temporal structures needed to entrain to discrepant temporal environments. We explain how contestation, temporal reflexivity, interpretive shifts, and mutual appreciation of interdependencies led to the reconstitution of Fairtrade's development model to bridge competing temporal structures. We contribute by (a) elucidating an agentic view of time, where time is used as a cultural resource to regulate attention and render social phenomena amenable to particular types of managerial action; (b) developing the notion of “ambitemporality,” where organizations accommodate seemingly contradictory temporal orientations; and (c) explaining how deep-seated Western organizational mentalities truncate the power of development models, and how these models may benefit from embracing processual approaches associated with Eastern thought.",ok

While multidisciplinary teams are critical for knowledge creation in increasingly specialized work environments, the coordination literature has been divided with respect to the extent to which such teams rely on formal coordination structures and informal coordination practices. Our findings show that when interdependencies among knowledge domains are dynamic and unpredictable, specialists design self-managed (sub-)teams around collectively held assumptions about interdependencies based on incomplete information (conjectural interdependencies). These team structures establish the grounds for informal coordination practices that enable specialists to both manage known interdependencies and reveal new interdependencies. Newly revealed interdependencies among knowledge domains, in turn, promote structural adaptation. Drawing on these findings, we advance an integrative model explaining how team-based knowledge creation relies on the mutual constitution of formal coordination structures and informal coordination practices. The model contributes to theory on organizational design and practice-based research on coordination in cross-disciplinary knowledge creation.",ok

Specifically, we theorize how internal firm dynamics and performance are affected by resource dependence by integrating resource orchestration (RO) into RDT. Building on RO, we argue that as the degree to which a firm is dependent upon a single source of revenue increases (a core tenet of RDT), the firm adjusts internally by reducing investments and the market responds negatively as well. Further, we argue that the heterogeneous nature of such dependence—namely, dependence scope (the spread of dependence throughout the entity with which the dependence relationship resides), dependence supplementation (the addition of new relationships within the prior dependence relationship), and dependence stability (the expected length of the dependence relationship)—moderates the relationship between the level of dependence and these outcomes. We find broad support for our theorizing in a longitudinal sample of manufacturing firms’ dependence upon governmental contracts for revenue. Collectively, we advance understanding of RDT by adding nuance to both explanatory mechanisms underlying dependence and conceptualizations of firms’ external dependence relationships, posing theoretical and practical implications.",ok

Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis of two samples of Internet-enabled firms largely supports our hypotheses. We find that novelty alone is insufficient for high performance, even when it appears as a necessary condition for very high performance in new technological environments. Our results highlight how novelty combines effectively with other value drivers (in particular with efficiency) and strategies (in particular with differentiation) contingent on the intensity of competition, firm size, and firms’ technological environment.

We argue that rival firms with common ownership structures will engage in dissimilar competitive action repertoires to avoid direct competition with each other. Competing aggressively, but with dissimilar action repertoires, allows rivals to maintain high levels of performance. Competing with dissimilar action repertoires also helps ensure that performance disparity between the two firms remains low. In other words, competitive aggressiveness with dissimilar action repertoires yields an optimal competitive solution for rival firms and their common owners.",ok

We argue that focal firm imitation scope and imitation speed drive performance, as well as imitation scope and speed decisions by rivals, which in turn influence focal firm performance. We also argue that the impact of this self-reinforcing Red Queen process on firms’ actions and performance is contingent on levels of product technology heterogeneity—defined as the extent to which the industry has multiple designs, resulting in product variety.

While current literature assumes these value propositions can be known ex ante and an appropriate ecosystem design derived from them, we focus on generative technological innovations that enable an unbounded range of potential value propositions, hence offering no clear guidance to firms. To illustrate our arguments, we inductively study two organizations, each attempting to create two novel ecosystems around new technological enablers deep in their industry architecture. We highlight how ecosystem creation in such conditions is a systemic process driven by coupled feedback loops, which organizations must try to control dynamically: firms first make the switch to creating the ecosystem, following an external pull to narrow down the range of potential applications; then need to learn to keep up with ecosystem dynamics by roadmapping and preempting, while simultaneously enacting resonance. Dynamic control further entails counteracting the drifting away of the nascent ecosystem from the firm’s idea of future value creation and the sliding of its intended control points for value capture. Our findings shed new light on strategy and control in emerging ecosystems, and provide guidance to managers on playing the ecosystem game.",ok

In addition, we propose a contiguity effect that emphasizes the broader social context of the community—its neighboring communities—as a source for support or information about appropriate ways to resist such pressures. By incorporating community attributes to account for organizations’ heterogeneous responses to institutional pressure, the study advances current institutional scholarship and demonstrates empirically how such a theory can help explain the success of relatively weak organizational actors’ resistance in the face of strong institutional pressures by the state—that is, as a result of their embeddedness in a community.",ok

When employees moralize intrinsic motivation, they perceive others with higher intrinsic motivation as being more moral and thus engage in more prosocial behavior toward those others, and judge others who are less intrinsically motivated as less moral and thereby engage in less prosocial behaviors toward them. We provide empirical support for our theoretical model across a large-scale, team-level field study in a Latin American financial institution (n = 784, k = 185) and a set of three online studies, including a preregistered experiment (n = 245, 243, and 1,245), where we develop a measure of the moralization of intrinsic motivation and provide both causal and mediating evidence.

Core theories of intergroup conflict suggest that such interteam resource conflicts unite teams internally, reducing intrateam power struggles. However, conflict spillover theory suggests that interteam conflicts may also stimulate competitive power dynamics within teams. We reconcile these two opposing lines of thought by introducing the internal power structure of teams as the key moderator that determines whether interteam conflict reduces or promotes power struggles within teams. We theorize that while the common fate of members of egalitarian teams makes them likely to unite and pool resources when facing an interteam conflict, the power differences in hierarchical teams cause members to be differently impacted by the resource-threatening interteam conflict, leading them to have different perspectives and concerns, thereby promoting internal fights over resources (i.e., power struggles). In turn, such power struggles are expected to negatively affect team performance. We tested these hypotheses with a laboratory study of 85 three-person negotiation teams and a field study of 158 organizational work teams, and found, as expected, that a resource-threatening interteam conflict promotes performance-detracting power struggles in hierarchical (but not egalitarian) teams.",ok

Although there is some evidence to support this notion, there is also evidence to suggest that status differences may amplify information sharing in diverse teams by offering status enhancement incentives to members who share unique knowledge. In this paper, we reconcile these different predictions by suggesting that the effects of status hierarchy on the relationship between knowledge diversity and team information sharing will depend on the stability of the hierarchy. Using a diverse sample of 156 teams across 110 organizations, we found that status differences constricted information sharing in knowledge-diverse teams when hierarchy stability was high and amplified information sharing in knowledge-diverse teams when hierarchy stability was low. These information sharing effects, in turn, affected team performance.

Building on exploratory interviews with board members and CEOs, we derive hypotheses from this argument in the context of local banks in the United States. We predict that the greater the level of decision uncertainty—due to rapid asset growth or operation in less predictable markets—the stronger the relationship between the proportion of banking expert directors and the probability of bank failure. Longitudinal analyses of 1,307 banks between 1996 and 2012 support this prediction, even after accounting for both the overall level of professional diversity among directors and banks’ different propensities to have an expert-heavy board.

Specifically, we theorize that leader humor quantity, irrespective of its quality, puts pressure on followers to engage in “surface acting” to fake or exaggerate positive emotions. We further propose that these surface acting responses are more likely to occur when followers hold high power distance values, such that followers more willingly comply with expectations to display positive emotions in response to leader humor expression. This increase in surface acting then leads to more emotional exhaustion and less job satisfaction for followers. Results from three studies—incorporating a field experiment, a laboratory experiment, and a multi-wave field study—provide support for these hypotheses.

In two studies including construction workers and a time-lagged study of medical residents, we find that the emotions of anger and hostility partially mediate the effects of perceived exploitation on employee engagement, revenge against the organization, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions, whereas the emotions of shame and guilt partially mediate the effects of perceived exploitation on employee burnout, silence, and psychological withdrawal.",ok

Phase 1 (disruption) is marked by a sudden and negative change in unit-level performance, while Phase 2 (recovery) entails a gradual increase in unit performance over time. We further propose that the positional distribution (manager or employee) of the turnover event and the amount of interdependence within the collective will influence the consequences of a turnover event. Using a sample of 524 branches of a U.S. bank, the results largely support the hypotheses as a turnover event leads to an immediate and negative change in branch-level performance. Notably, there is an interaction between manager and employee turnover events that significantly decreases performance. In the recovery period, branches recover more quickly after losing an employee than they do after losing a manager. However, the moderating effect of branch-level interdependence depends on the position, and there is no statistically significant recovery from a manager turnover event within our performance window. These results highlight the insights of our two-phase model and the need to study collective turnover dynamics over time and across different positions.",ok

Drawing upon conservation of resources theory, we develop and test a model that specifies how and when engaging in abusive supervisory behavior has immediate benefits for supervisors. Via two experiments and a multi-wave diary study across 10 consecutive workdays, we found that engaging in abusive supervisory behavior was associated with improved recovery level. Moreover, abusive supervisory behavior had a positive indirect effect on work engagement through recovery level. Interestingly, supplemental analyses suggested that these beneficial effects were short-lived because, over longer periods of time (i.e., one week and beyond), abusive supervisory behavior was negatively related to supervisors’ recovery level and engagement. The strength of these short-lived beneficial effects was also bound by personal and contextual factors. Empathic concern––a personal factor––and job demands––a contextual factor––moderated the observed effects. Specifically, supervisors with high empathic concern or low job demands experienced fewer benefits after engaging in abusive supervisory behavior. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings, and propose future research directions.",ok

We propose that new CEOs’ social influence behaviors may alter the adverse impacts of these factors on their early survival prospects. We examine two types of social influence behaviors displayed by new CEOs: (1) ingratiation toward predecessor CEOs and (2) self-promotion. We create proxies for such behaviors using a computer-aided content analysis of transcripts of new CEOs’ conference calls with securities analysts. We find that ingratiation toward predecessors reduces the adverse impact of predecessors’ remaining as board chairs while self-promotion mitigates the negative impact of negative stock market reactions. However, we also find evidence demonstrating that new CEOs’ social influence behaviors can backfire. Accordingly, our study makes important contributions to both the CEO succession literature and the social influence literature.",ok

We hypothesize that lower-status firms tend to bring higher-status alters into ventures on a better performance trajectory, whereas higher-status firms tend to bring lower-status alters into poorly performing ventures. Furthermore, we argue that these effects will be moderated by market heat, which affects whether investors would focus on the upside or downside of deals. We test our hypotheses in a longitudinal analysis of venture capital syndication patterns in the United States between 1990 and 2017. We find support for most of our predictions and document that the ability of lower-status lead investors to bring higher-status followers into good ventures is particularly accentuated in hot markets, which can heighten market participants’ concerns about missing good deals. We thus highlight the interplay between the internal and the external contexts in shaping the formation of status-asymmetric relationships.",ok

In this paper, I extend these views by exploring the underlying distribution of dyadic vicarious learning relationships in teams, specifically using a network approach to examine the consequences of reciprocity in team members’ vicarious learning with one another (i.e., where both individuals in a given dyad learn vicariously from each other’s knowledge and experience). Using a novel method for calculating weighted reciprocity in networks in a study of MBA consulting project teams, I demonstrate that greater team vicarious learning reciprocity is associated with greater team performance, and also moderates the performance consequences of teams’ external learning efforts, offering a potential reconciliation of conflicting results in prior research. In doing so, this paper advances research on vicarious learning in teams, while also providing conceptual and empirical tools for studying learning and other interpersonal workplace interactions from a network perspective.",ok

We develop theory to explain how and why leaders should enter into evaluations of the firms that they lead. Specifically, we propose that CEOs’ effects on corporate reputation will depend on leader prominence and on perceptions of leader quality. We thus test hypotheses that examine how CEOs’ media coverage, industry awards, and outsider standing affect the reputations of their firms. Our findings indicate that highly regarded CEOs enhance their firms’ reputations, sometimes substantially, and CEOs who receive negative press coverage damage their firms’ reputations.

Using data on inventor mobility and alliance formation among 42 global pharmaceutical firms over 16 years, we show that inventor mobility is positively associated with the likelihood of alliance formation in periods following inventor movements. This relationship becomes more pronounced if mobile employees bring additional knowledge about their prior firm’s technological capabilities and for alliances aimed at technology development rather than for agreements related to technology transfer. It is weakened, however, if a firm is already familiar with the competitor’s technological capabilities.

Building on a sociocognitive perspective, we propose that prospective resource providers respond differently to signals of different strengths and that the effectiveness of signals, especially weak signals, will be contingent on the media attention new firms receive. Empirically, we conduct a longitudinal analysis examining the ability of new private equity firms to raise a follow-on fund. Consistent with our theory, we find that unrealized performance, a relatively weak signal, positively influences fundraising. However, we fail to find statistical evidence that its effect is weaker than that of realized performance, a relatively strong signal. Further, media attention strengthens the relationship between unrealized performance and fundraising, but media attention exerts less impact on the relationship between realized performance and fundraising. Taken together, our findings deepen our understanding of how new firms can mobilize resources with signals of different strengths and of how the media—as a key information intermediary—differently impacts their effectiveness.",ok

We introduce two contingencies to explain when incumbents’ research investments in radical technologies translate into product development and when these upstream investments may get voided by organizational inertia downstream. First, radical technologies can differ in how they conform to incumbents’ existing business models, impacting the extent to which the movement of research outputs toward development will be subject to inertial pressures. Second, incumbents can invest in a radical technology through a variety of modes (internal research, external research contracts, alliances, acquisitions). These modes represent unique combinations of who does research and who is involved in the decision for subsequent development, and, hence, differ in the extent to which they are shielded from inertial pressures. This difference helps explain why incumbents, despite responding to radical technologies, may still be unable to adapt, as well as what types of investments will be more effective in helping firms navigate technological change.

These differences in understandings about the root causes of gender discrimination also produce divergent psychological consequences. We argue that perceived workplace gender discrimination (a) reduces self-efficacy among women but not among men and (b) reduces both men’s and women’s sense of belonging in the workplace.

We theorize that bias suppression with high accountability induces counterfactual thinking and regret and, ultimately, with subsequent low accountability, decision reversal. However, this process does not occur when accountability is initially low and subsequently high. Thus, intermittent accountability has an asymmetric effect on bias suppression over time—bias suppression is reversed (and biased decisions sustained). We initially provide proof of concept using Standard & Poor’s 500 Firms’ CEOs. We then conduct a field study of prominent decision-makers: U.S. Supreme Court judges (Study 1). We find that bias suppression is negatively associated with consistency when accountability is initially high but later reduced, as seemingly mediated through counterfactual thinking.

By tracking the movements of over 40,000 investment professionals in the U.S. private equity industry over 10 years, we investigate the consequences of the ideological misfit that arises when individuals’ political ideologies diverge substantially from the prevailing ideology of their firms. We hypothesize that ideological misfit increases the likelihood of departure, though the effects vary with liberal or conservative ideological orientation. Polynomial regression analyses reveal that the fit relationship between individual and organizational political ideology deviates from the idealized congruence relationship that underlies prevailing theory. Specifically, we find that departure is more likely for employees experiencing conservative misfit (a personal ideology more conservative than the firm’s) versus liberal misfit (a personal ideology more liberal than the firm’s). Conservatives are more likely to depart than liberals regardless of fit, and departing misfits tend to join new organizations that are closer to their own ideology.",ok

Based on a longitudinal case study of a dyadic strategic alliance, we develop a process model, describing how internal fragmentation within one of the partner organizations can lead to a counterintuitive relational pattern—namely, “dual relational dynamics”—where decision makers of both partners continue renewing their formal commitments, while simultaneously experiencing negative trust dynamics. We show that the existence of different belief systems within one partner organization can lead to a politically charged process, wherein different coalitions within this organization frame and act upon interorganizational events in different ways. This politically charged process can fuel both hope and disappointment among decision makers of both partner organizations, leading to dual relational dynamics.

In this paper, we present three studies that develop and test a model of social identity-based impression management (SIM) techniques used by pregnant workers. In Study 1 (n = 35), we utilized qualitative methods to identify the motives and strategies used by pregnant women to manage their professional images. In the second study, we collected two samples (n = 199 and n = 133) to develop and validate two scales based on the motives and strategies identified in Study 1. In Study 3 (n = 200), we employed a time-lagged design to examine how SIM motives and strategies affect important workplace outcomes: perceived discrimination, burnout, and returning to one's job after maternity leave. Our findings demonstrate both positive and negative outcomes of the motives and strategies women use to manage their images at work when pregnant.",ok

We test this model through an experience sampling study spread over 10 workdays with data from both supervisors and their subordinates.

Empirically, we focus our tests on the legalization of marijuana as a medicine in several U.S. states during the period 2000–2015, which has reduced the “vice” stigma around marijuana by highlighting the “health safety” attribute of marijuana, namely its safe consumption and potential health benefits. We show that legalization generated evaluative spillovers to other “vice” industries sharing the same health safety attribute as marijuana (i.e., alcohol), but not to those that did not share it (i.e., tobacco). Those spillovers were primarily observed when the law was accompanied by a patient registration system that highlighted the health safety attribute of marijuana by limiting its use to medical purposes.",ok

But do people build the network structure in which they perform best? We address this question by advancing a novel two-stage explanatory model that explicitly disentangles the network formation process from its performance effects. We hypothesize that “adaptors” (i.e., individuals inclined to focus on implementable solutions through commonly accepted and well-defined approaches) perform best when their network spans structural holes. Yet, these same individuals systematically forego opportunities to build relations across structural holes. By contrast, “innovators” (i.e., individuals inclined to focus on envisioning creative solutions that break away with established approaches) draw no or even negative performance returns from structural holes. Nevertheless, their inclination is to build ever-new bridging relations. We test and find support for this counterintuitive hypothesis through a randomized longitudinal field experiment enabling us to disentangle empirically both stages of our theorized process model. Our findings help illuminate why people may build networks that hurt their performance, shed a new light on the role of individual cognitive style in shaping network advantage, and bear concrete implications for organizations aiming to leverage networks to enhance employees’ performance.",ok

Our longitudinal process study explores how participants in the German Partnership for Sustainable Textiles successfully confronted the challenge of aligning frames across multiple interaction arenas, highlighting how failing to tackle this “two-table problem” can risk partnership collapse. Our process model captures how back-and-forth interactions enabled the stretching of shared frames across interaction arenas, thereby propelling the partnership from near collapse to deepened commitments. While stretching frames heightens the risk of frame break, our analysis shows how such iterative ongoing efforts are essential for deepening commitments and advancing collaboration. We thus contribute to framing theory by highlighting how frame alignment can be achieved across multiple interaction arenas by “collaborating on the edge of failure.” We further contribute to scholarship on multiparty collaboration by unpacking the multi-table negotiation dynamics that help explain collaborative outcomes.",ok

In response, we contribute to the microfoundations of organizational paradox with a theoretical model and robust measures that help unpack individuals’ varied approaches to tensions. Following rigorous scale development in Study 1, including samples from the U.S., UK, Israel, and China, we test our model in a large firm in the U.S. using quantitative and qualitative methods.

On the supply side, we argue that executives might accept smaller monetary rewards in exchange for acquiring experience in a new domain. Since category status also affects audience evaluations of candidates and candidates’ desire to affiliate with a specific social category, we further hypothesize that both demand and supply mechanisms are moderated by status differences between an executive’s origin and destination industries. Our analysis of voluntary mobility and compensation patterns of S&P 1500 executives supports these arguments: industry-changing executives realize lower compensation than closely matched within-industry movers. As expected, the compressing effect of changing industry on compensation is contingent upon status differences across industries. Executives who transition to higher-status industries face more stringent compensation discounts, while those moving to lower-status industries experience similar compensation variation as within-industry movers. Our study advances category and status-attainment research by incorporating the influence of industry prestige on career outcomes of cross-category moves, while casting light on the individual consequences of executive mobility.",ok

We find that some leaders enacted downward deference when they recognized that they had less expertise, networks, and influence relative to their local subordinates. This manifested in two ways: (a) attempts to reduce social distance, which involved seeking connection, earning trust, and participating in adjacent collaboration with local subordinates, and (b) yielding to subordinates’ expertise by privileging their judgment, transferring influence to them, and conforming to their local hierarchical expectations. Our supplementary quantitative analyses showed that previous experiences in foreign cultures, both in terms of total time spent abroad and exposure to cultures that were distant from their own, correlated with adopting downward deference. Those leaders also had higher job performance ratings, and were promoted to higher executive levels over time, compared to their counterparts who did not practice downward deference.

We propose two distinct but complementary mechanisms—learning and status attainment—to explain why some newcomers achieve superior performance and quicker promotions. We theorize that being assigned to complex projects offers newcomers opportunities to build competence and gain social recognition. Leveraging longitudinal archival data from a high-tech company where newcomers were randomly assigned to projects during their first two years, we found that those assigned to more complex projects obtained more professional certifications, reported higher levels of learning, and appeared more frequently in the company’s internal newsletters. These outcomes were associated with higher promotion rates, increased monetary rewards, and better supervisor evaluations.

To that end, I incorporate theory regarding corporate boards and their role in organizational decision making. I use this integration to suggest that boards with particular characteristics may have interests that do not align with those of the management team when performance shortfalls occur, using their influence to force compromises or compel managers to reconsider particular changes. I find support for the related predictions that an increase in board size and equity ownership suppresses change when performance drops, although I find no support for similar arguments regarding board turnover.

Such deep help consisted of (1) guiding a team through a difficult juncture by working with its members in several prolonged, tightly clustered sessions, or (2) path clearing by helping a team address a persistent deficit via briefer, intermittent sessions throughout a project’s life. We present a model theorizing these processes, which has two noteworthy features. First, it emphasizes the socially constructed nature of helping behavior. That is, the parties must establish and maintain a helping frame for their interaction, especially when help givers are high-status external leaders. Second, the model specifies that the rhythms of deep help—the duration and temporal patterns of giver–receiver interactions—are resource-allocation decisions that also contribute to the social meaning of help.

When movements rely on a private politics strategy to condemn an industry in the eyes of the public, social movement mass will be decisive. Alternatively, when movements use a public politics strategy to push for regulatory intervention, mobilization of elites is crucial. We develop our understanding of external contingency factors by exploring how cognitive legitimacy residuals from local ancestral populations affect both mass-driven private politics and elite-driven public politics, and how national-level industry countermobilization efforts affect elite-driven public politics strategies. We test these ideas in a historical study of the Scottish whisky distilling industry during the rise of temperance movements (1823–1921).

We found support for this interactive effect of idea enactment and influence tactics in two studies: a field study of 192 employees and 54 supervisors in a video game and animation company and an experimental study with 264 participants. In the experimental study, we also demonstrated that the benefits of using this dual approach are more likely to accrue when selling a more novel idea rather than a less novel, more mundane one. Both studies highlight the mediating role of supervisors’ creativity assessment in implementing employees’ creative ideas.",ok

Challenging this, we argue that family motivation is a double-edged sword with both an energizing and a debilitating effect on employee performance, depending on the performance criterion in question. Specifically, drawing upon self-determination theory and the “hard work versus smart work” framework, we hypothesize that family motivation is positively related to employee productivity via enhanced work effort (i.e., energizing effect). However, family motivation also stimulates employees to see their jobs as a means to gain financial support for their family, rather than an end in itself, which is associated with lower levels of creativity (i.e., debilitating effect). We further propose that employees’ family motivation is higher when they experience higher levels of family financial pressure, and that financial pressure is more strongly related to family motivation for women than for men. We find support for our hypotheses in a sample of 187 low-wage, blue-collar workers and a sample of 439 relatively high-income, white-collar employees. We also conduct a qualitative study with 40 high-income employees; results provide a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which family motivation shapes perceptions of the job and subsequent behaviors and outcomes.",ok

However, under extreme resource constraints, organizations are unable to sacrifice resources now for benefits later without risking their survival. In these conditions, prior theory has suggested that organizations would be present focused, making sustainable development elusive. Through an ethnographic study, we investigated how tea producer organizations in eight communities in East Africa confronting severe resource constraints acted for sustainable development. We discovered that a “present” time perspective is richer than has been described previously. Prior time research has described the present as a “moment” in time, which allows managers to juxtapose the present against the future to make the intertemporal trade-offs for sustainable development. However, our tea producers did not see the future as a trade-off with the present. We discovered that they see duration in the present—what we call a “long present.” Because the present is long, they see connections among processes such as resource flows, which inspired incremental actions that continuously ease extreme resource shortages. We therefore offer an alternative to the trade-off thinking that currently dominates sustainable development discourse.",ok

Based on this interactionist model, personality–performance correlations were located in the literature, and occupationally homogeneous jobs were coded according to their theoretically relevant contextual properties. Results revealed that all five traits were more predictive of performance for jobs in which the process by which the work was done represented weak situations (e.g., work was unstructured, employee had discretion to make decisions). Many of the traits also predicted performance in job contexts that activated specific traits (e.g., extraversion better predicted performance in jobs requiring social skills, agreeableness was less positively related to performance in competitive contexts, openness was more strongly related to performance in jobs with strong innovation/creativity requirements). Overall, the study’s findings supported our interactionist model in which the situation exerts both general and specific effects on the degree to which personality predicts job performance.",ok

We find that regulatory mandates dampen the effect of competitors’ new resource investments on a focal firm’s new resource investments. Distinguishing between different clean technology types, we show that this dampening effect is the stronger, the more distant the new resource is from incumbents’ old resource base, and the more established the mandate is.

Paradoxically, these same “healthcare heroes” who were being publicly celebrated for their work in the fight against a novel coronavirus also faced stigma for their work amid the virus and infected patients. Using grounded theory, we document how stigmatized members of an occupation experience and respond to mixed—and even conflicting—social evaluations. We contribute to the literature on stigma and social evaluations more broadly by showing how targets of stigma evaluate their evaluators through nuanced logical and emotional processing and, moreover, that such processing can lead recipients of mixed evaluations toward a number of outcomes not previously theorized. We explore the concept of “dirty heroes,” where workers are celebrated and stigmatized along distinct dimensions of work traditionally studied in dirty work (i.e., physical, social, and moral).

Conversely, factors that increase founder CEOs’ organizational identification—specifically, the length of time that their organization was a private firm and core founder status—will negatively affect their voluntary succession. We find strong support for our arguments in the context of firms that undertook an initial public offering during the period from 2000 to 2013.

Empirical analysis reveals strong evidence that a firm's escalating tendency is increased by larger competitors' high action volume and smaller competitors' positive performance.

Our study contributes to disentangling this puzzling effect. We argue that family firms—owing to the family’s high level of control over the firm, wealth concentration, and importance of nonfinancial goals—invest less in innovation but have an increased conversion rate of innovation input into output and, ultimately, a higher innovation output than nonfamily firms. Empirical evidence from a meta-analysis based on 108 primary studies from 42 countries supports our hypotheses. We further argue and empirically show that the observed effects are even stronger when the CEO of the family firm is a later-generation family member. However, when the CEO of the family firm is the firm’s founder, innovation input is higher and, contrary to our initial expectations, innovation output is lower than that in other firms.

Existing theory has suggested that the choice of formal control structure can play an important role in mitigating conflict, but a longstanding debate exists as to whether flat versus hierarchical control structures are more effective. To add further insight into this theoretical discussion, we conducted a field experiment involving 40 newly formed cooperatives in rural Ghana, which were randomly assigned to either a flat or hierarchical control structure. The quantitative results of our field experiment and subsequent qualitative data suggest that formal hierarchical control structures lead to lower levels of collective psychological ownership, which in turn result in higher levels of conflict compared to flat control structures within cooperatives.

Drawing on interview, archival, and observational data, we analyze how rules for exchanging genomic data emerged, and how entrepreneurial technology-development moves influenced those rules. Our findings reveal a four-step process, which we call the technological entrainment of moral issues, involving the progressive synchronization of framings, technical policies, technologies (software), exchange platforms, and market participant behaviors. This process baked particular moral stances on privacy and ownership into technological designs, which then dictated the rules market participants were required to follow to engage in exchange. We conclude that when markets are digital, technology processes central to exchange end up controlling many moral aspects of exchange. Our study contributes to theories of morally contentious markets and cultural or institutional entrepreneurship by illuminating how those theories can incorporate material (not only symbolic) aspects of technology processes and better explain the emerging moral order within the rapidly expanding realm of digital markets.",ok

In this study, we focus on the differences in demand uncertainty between network products and standalone products competing in such a market. We develop theory predicting how a product’s social features interact with other known drivers of demand uncertainty to impact diffusion. We test our arguments in the global board games industry, where board games designed around the collection and trading of “collectible components” compete against traditional board games. Results show that network products exhibit greater variance in diffusion and that their diffusion is disproportionately affected by the degree of product novelty and the intensity and type of competition.

Without this responsiveness, regulatory compliance is even less likely than if the firm did not participate at all.

I integrate this perspective with transactional stress theory to propose that job insecurity has a disproportionately negative effect on employees from poorer backgrounds, leading to lower engagement and higher emotional exhaustion among such employees, while those from wealthier backgrounds are buffered against these effects. These responses to job insecurity, in turn, amplify job loss risk for employees from poorer backgrounds, regardless of employees’ current job or financial situation. A preregistered, multisource, five-wave longitudinal study conducted at the height of the COVID-19 crisis in India found support for these predictions.

We find that employees’ encounters with measurement practices both affirm and challenge perceptions of work as worthy by influencing whether employees can accomplish their work tasks, see the impact of their work, and have a credible and valued voice in their interpersonal interactions. Building on these findings, we develop a model that theorizes practical, existential, and relational pathways through which measurement encounters create ongoing expansions and contractions of work worthiness.

These beliefs, alongside evidence supporting them, determine which specific responses firms adopt. To test this argument, we focus on two types of search solutions represented by research and development (R&D) intensity and philanthropic donation intensity. Based on 2009–2018 data collected from publicly listed Chinese firms, we find that, when decision-makers agree on the effectiveness of R&D, the positive relationship between performance shortfalls and R&D intensity strengthens; whereas when they agree on the effectiveness of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the negative relationship between performance shortfalls and donation intensity weakens. The effects of shared beliefs on the effectiveness of R&D and CSR are stronger when they are supported by relevant evidence—that is, when there is a stronger correlation between R&D or CSR on the one hand and firm performance on the other.",ok

We also posit that experiential learning helps firms manage the two types of uncertainty, and thereby reduces the need for partnering—yet, experience in the host country makes partnering more feasible and increases the likelihood of such partnerships. To test our hypotheses, we conceptualize the decision to partner with a local firm in a foreign venture as a multilayered decision, and model it accordingly.

While past work has tended to characterize de-identification efforts as ultimately successful, I reveal how individuals can remain stuck in their identifications and experience identity paralysis. In doing so I add nuance to our understanding of de-identification by revealing the factors that can contribute to its breakdown and failure. I highlight specifically the importance of identity material and the content of institutional logics in influencing de-identification processes, and thus extend the existing focus on the cognitive accessibility of logics. Importantly, I reveal that challenges to de-identification result not merely from the individuals “holding on” to old targets but rather from their becoming stuck and resigning themselves to existing targets when they simultaneously feel they lack identity material to realize new identities and face negative social evaluations. Indeed my findings point to the powerful and durable ways in which institutions shape our identities even when we desire to change them.",ok

We examine this contention in Iran, a political context that sharply deviates from the exclusively studied U.S. context. We find that social and economic conservatism exert opposing effects on corporate entrepreneurship through distinct strategic decision-making processes; CEO social conservatism positively affects corporate entrepreneurship by promoting intuitive strategic decision-making, whereas CEO economic conservatism negatively affects corporate entrepreneurship by impairing cooperative strategic decision- making. These results highlight the need to separate social and economic ideologies, especially in non-U.S. contexts, and inform the underlying strategic decision-making processes through which executive ideology shapes strategic behaviors.

In a lab experiment and a multisource, multiwave field study, we found that for internals, leader perfectionism had a curvilinear effect on their engagement (but no effect on emotional exhaustion) and subsequent creativity such that the effect was positive but became weaker when leader perfectionism was extreme. By contrast, we found partial support across the two studies that for externals, leader perfectionism had a positive effect on their emotional exhaustion (but no effect on engagement), which undermined their creativity.

We test predictions from this framework using meta-analytic techniques on a sample of 146 primary studies conducted in 33 different countries. We find that female representation in the upper echelons in general is positively and weakly related to forms of long-term financial performance, but negatively and weakly related to short-term stock market returns. We observe that reduced strategic risk-taking is a mediating mechanism that explains why financial performance is improved.

In a sample of employed adults, we used an experience sampling method to capture within-individual variation in small talk over a three-week period. Given that we are the first to examine small talk as an episodic phenomenon, we also conducted a validation of our daily small talk measure with master’s students and two samples of employed adults. Using multilevel path analysis, results show that small talk enhanced employees’ daily positive social emotions at work, which heightened organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) and enhanced well-being at the end of the workday; furthermore, small talk disrupted employees’ ability to cognitively engage in their work, which compromised their OCB. Additionally, higher levels of trait-level self-monitoring mitigated negative effects of small talk on work engagement. Combined, results suggest that the polite, ritualistic, and formulaic nature of small talk is uplifting yet also distracting.",ok

Our empirical analysis of voluntary patent expirations (i.e., patents that firms give up by not paying renewal fees) in 97 pharmaceutical firms between 1980 and 2002 shows that the number, importance, and timing of small failures are associated with a decrease in R&D output (patent count) but an increase in the quality of the R&D output (forward citations to patents).

Because organizations’ market identities are certified by expert evaluations, consumers’ devaluations that challenge these expert evaluations represent an identity threat. However, organizations do not always react to consumers’ devaluations because of the risks associated with public responses. Hence, we first predict that organizations are more likely to respond to severe devaluations than to weaker ones; second, we propose that organizations, when faced with severe devaluations, are more likely to craft responses that justify their actions and behaviors. We further contend that, for any market identity under consideration, an organization’s reputation amplifies these relationships.

Existing theory on capitalization has been developed within the context of close relationships where individuals typically maintain aligned outcomes. However, when outcomes are opposed such as when individuals are competing, capitalization may not be an effective relationship behavior as currently conceptualized. In this work, I examine the consequences of capitalization within the workplace, a context that is characteristically competitive. I build a model of workplace interpersonal capitalization, defined as the process of sharing personal work-related positive events with coworkers. Drawing from social comparison theory, I posit that hearing a coworker disclose work-related positive events causes an employee to experience either inspiration or envy as a function of the degree to which the disclosing coworker is viewed as a competitor. Furthermore, I explain how these inspirational and envious reactions motivate interpersonal citizenship behavior and social undermining, respectively. Overall, I establish distinct responder-based reactions and postulate competition as a key boundary condition that alters the effects of capitalization.",ok

In this study, we begin to unpack the micro-foundations of firm-specific human capital by theoretically and empirically exploring when employees perceive their skills to be firm-specific. We first develop theoretical arguments and hypotheses based on the extant strategy literature, which implicitly assumes information efficiency and unbiased perceptions of firm-specificity. We then relax these assumptions and develop alternative hypotheses rooted in the cognitive psychology literature, which highlights biases in human judgment. We test our hypotheses using two data sources from Korea and the United States. Surprisingly, our results support the hypotheses based on cognitive bias—a stark contrast to expectations embedded within the strategy literature. Specifically, we find organizational commitment and, to some extent, tenure are negatively related to employee perceptions of the firm-specificity. We also find that employer-provided on-the-job training is unrelated to perceived firm-specificity. These results suggest that firm-specific human capital, as perceived by employees, may drive behavior in ways unanticipated by existing theory—for example, with respect to investments in skills or turnover decisions. This, in turn, may challenge the assumed relationship between firm-specific human capital and sustained competitive advantage. More broadly, our findings may suggest a need to reconsider other theories, such as transaction cost economics, that draw heavily on firm-specificity and implicitly assume widely shared and unbiased perceptions.",ok

Building on and extending the relational demography literature, we argue that immigrants’ trajectories of social undermining—whether increasing or decreasing—are strongly influenced by levels of regional far-right support. Immigrants’ social undermining trajectories signal to them the feasibility of achieving a high-status identity at work, thereby impacting their well-being. We find support for our model in a unique dataset matching apprentices in Germany (tracked from day one of their apprenticeship over 13 weeks) with German election data. Specifically, we find that immigrants perceive increasing (decreasing) social undermining by their coworkers over time when employed in a region with higher (lower) far-right political support.

We address this gap by examining how lay theories people hold about instrumental relations affect dispositional similarity-attraction. Because people who hold a fixed (versus growth) theory of instrumental relations believe that relationships form primarily on the basis of natural compatibility (versus effort), they should be particularly prone to similarity-attraction on the basis of dispositional similarity in values, attitudes, and personality traits. To test our arguments, we first develop a lay theories of instrumental relations scale, which we use to demonstrate that holding a growth theory decreases (moderates) people’s tendency to avoid dispositionally dissimilar partners in a naturally occurring network (Field Study) and a dyadic task (Experiment 1). Finally (Experiment 2), we manipulate lay theories to show that inducing growth theories increases people’s satisfaction with a task partner who is dispositionally dissimilar.

Using an experimental study and a sample of 76 multiteam systems observed over three performance episodes, we provide evidence that structural hierarchy (a) facilitates multiteam system learning by mitigating cognitive depletion among members, but (b) undermines multiteam system learning via its deleterious effects on horizontal coordination. Critically, however, we find that the benefits of hierarchy (i.e., reduced cognitive depletion) wane over performance episodes. This investigation underscores the important role that different hierarchical arrangements play in multiteam system functioning.

We present three studies that test our theorizing: a quasi-experimental field study with 260 employees, a day-reconstruction study with 238 employees, and a one-day experience sampling study with 319 employees. Across the studies, we find that chronotype moderates the effect of time of day on creativity. Overall, late chronotypes were more creative in the late afternoon and early chronotypes tended to be more creative in the morning. The alignment between chronotype and time of day also gave rise to positive mood and creative self-efficacy; however, the studies provide only partial support for the hypothesis that positive mood acts as a mediating mechanism.

We test this by examining a period of growth in a Fortune 500 company and evaluate gains and losses associated with moving employees within firms, including distinguishing between two types of internal movers—those who come from different units in the organization (solo movers) and those who come from the same unit in the organization (comobile movers).

Through their symbolic representations of self, they find common ground (often through shared nonwork experiences), establish a common understanding of employees' work roles, and share personalistic information about the self—all of which contribute to relationship development among employees and their coworkers, customers, and clients. With symbolic representations of self that offer an optimal amount of stimulation, they focus their attention on their goals and values and establish a desired boundary or integration between work and nonwork—both of which contribute to employees' self-regulation.

However, amid broad technology adoption pressures—expectations on organizations lacking precise prescriptions, success criteria, and sanctions—novel middle-ground approaches might emerge. Our 16-month ethnography of a Finnish school indicates that intraprofessional segmentation—specialization of work tasks within a professional community—can allow organizations to navigate technology adoption while balancing professional autonomy and managerial goals. This segmentation supported managers’ and certain teachers’ enthusiasm about new technologies at work, without undermining other teachers’ autonomy. This segmentation emerged, persisted, and intensified through two processes. First, it emerged through differentiating practices, which allowed a divergence of what teachers said and did regarding technology. Second, this segmentation persisted and intensified through reinforcing practices, which furthered differentiation by formalizing, reorganizing, and strengthening it.

We find that the three imaginativeness skills vary across individuals and that they predict new venture idea quantity and quality differently over and above the effects of motivation, knowledge, and experience. We conclude with implications for theory development in entrepreneurship and creative problem-solving.",ok

We argue that producers compete against prior and current competitors, and against their past selves. In the context of 153 artists active during a key period of the emergence of modern art (1905–1916), we utilize a convolutional neural network used in computer vision to extract feature vectors of artworks, and measure quantitative distance of these artists’ works from canonical reference points. We find that artists are rewarded for distinctiveness from prior and current competitors and their past selves (up to a point). However, artists’ autonomy to differentiate themselves depends on their position in the social structure, which we divide into supply-side artist-to-artist networks, and demand-side artist-to-gallerist networks. Artists with high or low supply-side status receive higher rewards for distinctiveness from current competitors than do artists with middle supply-side status. Artists with higher demand-side status receive higher rewards for distinctiveness from their own past, but lower rewards for distinctiveness from current competitors. These results show that peers strive to constrain each other to conform to positions of gravity within product space, and that market audiences deploy either higher or lower constraints on a producer’s identity depending on the reference point.",ok

Thus, feedback-induced change, while likely intended to increase the viability of creative ideas, might paradoxically undermine that viability by compromising creative workers’ associated identity-based relationships with their creative endeavors. While existing scholarship has established the importance of creative revision, research has largely overlooked how this vital process intersects with creative workers’ identities. Through a field study of 59 founders and their entrepreneurial ideas, I present an identity-based process model of creative revision that highlights differences in founders’ psychological ownership of their ideas and how those differences affect subsequent revision efforts. The emerging findings contribute to existing theory by revealing that the capacity to extend the novelty and usefulness of one’s ideas is not merely subject to informational constraints but also to identity-based constraints.",ok

Thus, studying these collaborations provides an opportunity to more broadly explore how organizations balance knowledge search or exploration efforts with their needs to manage organizational legitimacy. Accordingly, I suggest that collaboration facilitates access to external information, and that organizations pursue it when the information is needed to solve related problems. However, I also argue that collaborations reciprocally allow stakeholders to more directly scrutinize organizational practices. Thus, I predict that organizations suppress their use of collaborations to solve problems when their legitimacy is potentially or already at risk, such as when powerful stakeholders can hold an organization accountable for inappropriate acts or when some organizational actions have already been deemed as controversial. I test related predictions on the community policing efforts of a law enforcement agency panel, finding general support for several of the study’s predictions.",ok

Three corresponding yet opposing founder practices are present in cases with low business model innovation. When interpreted through the lens of imprinting theory, our findings reveal how founders achieve novelty imprinting, which we conceive as imprinting processes that result in novel imprints.

To secure investment, entrepreneurs can signal about their venture’s latent potential by aligning themselves with reliable third parties. Such affiliations affirm the new venture’s legitimacy and provide substantive benefits in the form of mentoring, access to resources, and ongoing monitoring. However, early stage financing is an especially “noisy” signaling environment owing to the large number of startups seeking funding, many of which will not survive. The real value of third-party affiliations in this context resides in their ability to unlock the potential of other more pedestrian signals, such as the entrepreneur’s characteristics and actions that might otherwise go unnoticed. We borrow from the sensemaking literature to explain how third-party affiliation signals disambiguate signals with multiple possible interpretations so that potential investors interpret them positively. Findings support our theory that a startup’s characteristics and actions are signals that remain relatively unnoticed unless a startup combines them with a third-party affiliation that enhances the signal’s value, thus increasing the likelihood of receiving external capital.",ok

Drawing on uncertainty management theory, we merge these two streams of research and introduce the concept of “justice variability,” which captures between-person differences in the stability of fairness over time. Contrary to the intuitive notion that more fairness is always better, our work shows that being treated consistently unfairly can be better for employees than being treated fairly sometimes and unfairly at other times. Specifically, in a lab study, variably fair treatment resulted in greater physiological stress than both consistently fair and consistently unfair treatment. In a multilevel, experience-sampling field study, we replicated the positive association between justice variability and stress, and we also showed that justice variability exacerbated the positive, daily relationship between general workplace uncertainty and stress. Moreover, daily stress mediated the effects of justice variability on daily job dissatisfaction and emotional exhaustion.

Drawing on the concept of temporal focus, we theorize that present-focused CEOs adhere to the BAM’s endowment effect, while exhibiting even stronger relationships between current and prospective wealth and risk taking. In contrast, by nature of being forward-looking, future-focused CEOs endow prospective wealth instead of current wealth, thereby reversing the main relationships of the BAM.

Drawing from evolutionary theory arguments related to birth order, we theorize that CEO birth order is positively associated with strategic risk taking; that is, earlier-born CEOs will take less risk than later-born CEOs. As evolutionary theory proposes that birth order effects are driven by sibling rivalry, we also argue that this relationship is moderated by three factors related to sibling rivalry: age gap between a CEO and the closest born sibling, CEO age, and the presence of a sibling CEO. Our results provide support for our theorizing and suggest that birth order may have important implications for organizations.

Building on a six-month autoethnography of a consulting assignment, we show that authority is a practical, relational, and situated performance. It exists in a tension between two mirroring processes—activation and passivation—through which relations are either leveraged or downplayed to shape the situation and steer collective action. Our study also reveals that the performance of authority involves not just people, but also a broader range of actants, including artifacts and abstract entities. In line with current research on performativity in organizations, our findings contribute to the relational program on authority and the revelation of its sociomaterial dimension.

We propose that local firms’ responses are shaped by their affiliation with, and position in, a business group. Using data on investment announcements by MNEs and local firms in India from 1995 to 2010, we find that firms that are affiliated with business groups tend to be more sensitive to MNE investment announcements than are stand-alone firms. More professionally managed group affiliate firms are more likely to respond to MNE threats. Furthermore, firms that are in the group’s identity domain—that is, those holding more prominent positions within their group (especially as measured by centrality in the group’s directorship network)—appear more likely to respond to MNE investment announcements.

We challenge this hypothesis by revisiting its fundamental assumptions and developing a theory according to which actors’ propensity to conform based on their achieved status further depends on the ascribed status that they inherit from their social group. Specifically, we propose that middle-status conformity applies only to actors who have a sense of security, based on their high ascribed status.

We find that partnerships became more common after the scandal’s disclosure, as firms and nonprofits sought to collaborate on socioeconomic development. However, firms seen as directly or indirectly implicated in the scandal struggled to form partnerships due to risks to nonprofits’ legitimacy. Moreover, nonprofits perceived as closely aligned with firms (i.e., trade associations) or the state (i.e., education and research nonprofits or those with political capital) were especially cautious about entering partnerships to avoid appearing complicit in advancing corporate political influence. Our findings thus “check” the instrumentalization of corporate-nonprofit partnerships in two ways: by examining how it unfolds after an institutional crisis and by revealing how nonprofits resist being used as vehicles for corporate reputational repair or political gain.

Contributors whose ideas are misaligned with the organization’s selection tend to stop submitting ideas (i.e., self-selection) or adjust the ideas they submit so that they correspond (i.e., self-adjustment), resulting in a less diverse pool of ideas. Our central hypothesis is that the more consistent organizations are in their selection, the stronger the coevolutionary lock-in: organizations with greater selection consistency receive future ideas with lower content variety. We find support for these predictions by combining large-scale network analysis and natural language processing across a large number of organizations that use crowdsourcing. Our findings suggest a reconceptualization of external search as a two-way street: organizations are not simply passive receivers of ideas but send signals that shape the pool of ideas that externals share.",ok

To answer this question, we study how corporate benefaction affects the process of peer recognition in the context of Russian theaters from 2004 to 2011. First, we engage in a qualitative exploration of our setting to contextualize our hypotheses and understand how relationships with corporate donors, depending on their characteristics, affect peer recognition. We then quantitatively test our hypotheses and confirm that the salience of the relationship with extraneous stakeholders—operationalized as the number of corporate donors—has a negative effect on peer recognition. However, we find that this effect can be mitigated if theaters choose to limit the breadth, depth, and negative valence of the relationship. We contribute to both the institutional logics and stakeholder literatures by bringing in a signaling perspective: we show that peer recognition, upon which the maintenance of a dominant logic lies, is directly impacted by the nature of relationships with extraneous stakeholders.",ok

Drawing from gestalt characteristics and event system theories, we take a dynamic approach to examine the “peak” moments of entrepreneurs’ displayed joy—specifically, the strength and duration of peak displayed joy during different phases of a pitch. We analyzed data from over eight million frames in 1,460 pitch videos, using the latest facial expression analysis technology. The findings unveil the benefit of pitching with a greater level of peak displayed joy, especially during the beginning and ending phases of a pitch. Moreover, the amount of time an entrepreneur spends at the peak level of his or her displayed joy has an inverted U-shaped relationship with funding performance. This research highlights not only the importance of investigating emotion temporal dynamics in the interpersonal context, but also the unique research opportunities provided by facial expression analyses in understanding complex management phenomena.",ok

We introduce and define reaction costs as costs that signal senders incur when unintended audiences react negatively to a true signal that was intended for another audience. We argue that activist hedge funds—an unintended audience—treat CSR as a signal that firms have wasteful intentions and capabilities, which prevent firms from maximizing shareholder value in the short term. On that basis, we hypothesize that activist hedge funds are more likely to target firms with higher levels of CSR, thus imposing reaction costs on these firms. We further argue that this relationship is weaker when firms operate in industries with high levels of CSR, and stronger when firms’ financial communication is vague. Using data on activist hedge fund campaigns in the U.S. between 2000 and 2016, we find supporting results. Our study shows that CSR signals may be costlier than previously assumed and contributes to research on CSR, signaling, and corporate governance.",ok

To reconcile the conflicting results, we statistically combine the results from 140 studies and examine whether these results vary by firms’ legal/regulatory and socio-cultural contexts. We find that female board representation is positively related to accounting returns and that this relationship is more positive in countries with stronger shareholder protections—perhaps because shareholder protections motivate boards to use the different knowledge, experience, and values that each member brings. We also find that, although the relationship between female board representation and market performance is near zero the relationship is positive in countries with greater gender parity (and negative in countries with low gender parity)—perhaps because societal gender differences in human capital may influence investors’ evaluations of the future earning potential of firms that have more female directors. Lastly, we find that female board representation is positively related to boards’ two primary responsibilities: monitoring and strategy involvement. For both firm financial performance and board activities, we find mean effect sizes comparable to those found in meta-analyses of other aspects of board composition.

We develop the argument that while conformity in CSR scope enhances analyst coverage, differentiation in CSR emphasis leads to more-favorable analyst recommendations and higher market value. This suggests that firms may be able to simultaneously conform in CSR scope and differentiate in CSR emphasis to achieve optimal distinctiveness. To further enhance our understanding of the variation in the relationship between conformity and differentiation and the response of analysts and the market, we investigate how some firm- and analyst-level factors moderate this relationship. Using the case of corporate social activities of Chinese listed firms during the period from 2008 to 2014, we show that scope conformity has a stronger effect on analyst coverage for state-owned firms and firms with higher visibility; on the other hand, the relationship between emphasis differentiation, and analyst recommendation and market value strengthens for firms covered by high-status brokerage houses but weakens for those experiencing high earnings pressure.",ok

These experts are related to an increase in a firm’s innovation when they take a technology role as inventors, and particularly when they take a governance role on a fledgling firm’s board. However, despite their frequent involvement in executive roles, surgeon–executives are less likely to be helpful, and especially likely to block innovation, as chief executives. Our results emphasize expert users as a critical external dependency for a young firm’s innovation, but show that expertise can backfire when there is a mismatch with a particular organizational role. A key finding is that expert users are more helpful in suggesting a broad variety of solutions to a firm’s innovation problems but less helpful in selecting the best ones for the organization to pursue.

We suggest that such networks engender specific social capital in terms of information conduits, trust, and common vernaculars that is ideal for inventors to translate and share with their cluster members the technological insights that they have derived from outside sources. Moreover, any insularity that may result from having cohesive clusters is mitigated by internal competition between clusters. In contrast, having a highly connected inventor network engenders social capital that impedes incumbents’ absorption of new venture technologies. Broadly distributed access to internal technology, combined with a strong social identity that results from high levels of connectedness, can lead to insularity and a “not invented here” syndrome. We also find that highly connected internal inventor networks diminish any advantage that incumbent firms gain from having corporate venture capital investments in new ventures in terms of absorbing their technologies.",ok

We argue that institutions and social capital are not simply predictors of ownership structure but can also be historically persistent mechanisms through which past traumatic shocks to society shape modern businesses. Using data from over 30,000 firms across 41 sub-Saharan countries, we show that firms in areas that suffered high historical slave extraction are today more likely to have concentrated ownership. High slave export countries have more sole proprietorships and majority ownership, with our model implying a difference of 43 percentage points between the lowest and highest export countries. This difference is particularly pronounced in the manufacturing sector, where high capital needs can necessitate diffuse ownership when credit markets are weak. Finally, we present modest evidence that weakened institutions and social capital are among the mechanisms through which the historical slave trade increases modern ownership concentration. Our paper answers recent calls to bring both Africa and history back into management research through our theoretical extension into distinct and quantifiable historical origins of firm structure.",ok

While prior research has examined how competing events may draw attention away, our theory leads us to consider the circumstances that will motivate employees to maintain attention on learning from failure that has already occurred. Our framework examines the conditions that preserve attention to past failures by increasing the perception that related issues exist elsewhere, serving as continuing reminders of or cues about the failure when attention begins to drift away. We find support for related hypotheses involving a failure’s complexity, the firm’s culpability, and the ongoing use of routines related to those involved in the failure. Our findings contribute to the attention-based view by developing theory about attentional engagement and vigilance and by emphasizing the conditions that can keep attention focused on, rather drawn away from, past failure.

We theorize that factors such as novelty and legitimacy, appropriation, and integration impact the ability of cluster hires to generate economic value. In turn, we hypothesize that the composition of the cluster hire (degree of expertise overlap and degree of co-mobility) and its fit with the strategic human capital at the hiring firm are likely to influence these factors to affect firm performance. The results from an archival study of cluster hires in 112 domestic U.S. law firms lend credence to the overarching perspective put forth in this paper, and demonstrate that the performance impact of cluster hiring is contingent on its composition and fit with the existing strategic human capital at the hiring firm. Specifically, we find that while the co-mobility dimension has a negative impact on firm performance, the degree of expertise overlap is positively related to firm performance when it adds strategic human capital to an area where the hiring firm has little or no presence. Additionally, we find that expertise overlap positively impacts firm performance when the cluster hire involves low levels of co-mobility.",ok

First, we extend theorizing regarding institutional waves to explain why organizations’ rate of change on disclosed metrics are likely to follow a tapering pattern such that improvement occurs most rapidly immediately following the start of an IDP, and then slows with time. Second, we explain why organizations that exhibit the worst initial performance are also likely to exhibit more pronounced tapering in their rates of change. Third, we begin to reconcile competing predictions regarding how organizational size affects organizations’ responses to IDPs by theorizing and testing temporal moderation effects between size and (1) rates of initial improvement and (2) extent of tapering. We test our theory using panel data on motor carrier safety obtained from governmental databases following the implementation of a new IDP in 2010.

This suggests that more male unethical negotiation behavior should primarily emerge in situations associated with intrasexual competition. Using a two-wave survey design, Study 1 found a positive relationship between mating motivation and unethical negotiation behavior for male, but not female, employees. Study 2 was a controlled experiment, replicating this effect and showing that the gender difference was most pronounced when negotiating with same-sex, attractive opponents. Study 3 used a similar experimental design and found support for another implication of evolutionary theory—that mating motivation would prompt unethical behavior in both men and women when the behavior constitutes a less severe norm violation.

We also discuss how people can understand their relationships better by comparing them to a relevant and proximal referent; this underlines how prior levels of LMX serve as a lens by which followers evaluate their current LMX. Across two studies, we discuss how comparing this week’s LMX to last week’s LMX can signal improvement (i.e., gains) or deterioration (i.e., losses) in the relationship, with differential implications for positive and negative affect. We also provide additional insights into LMX fluctuations by contrasting within- and between-individual variance in established and newly founded relationships, and by examining those incidents that are more likely to influence LMX in a given week.",ok

We analyze observational data on more than 29,000 venture capital deals and develop two experimental studies. Our findings support our hypotheses that subcategory spanning lowers valuation, and that this effect is attenuated as investors’ expertise increases.

However, from a sensemaking perspective, newcomers may also draw insight from stakeholder behavior in order to better understand how to best meet job-related objectives and expectations. These understandings may manifest as performance-related motives, leading to the adoption of risky behaviors that can be detrimental to newcomer health and organizational effectiveness. Using multisource, multilevel, and longitudinal data, we demonstrate that the alcohol use norms of both organizational veterans and clients are significantly associated with the performance drinking motives of newcomers in sales and client service teams, suggesting that veteran and client norms signal to newcomers that drinking alcohol is an effective and legitimate means to improve job performance. In addition, we demonstrate that performance drinking motives mediate the positive relationship between veteran and client alcohol use norms and newcomers' frequency of work-based heavy drinking. Finally, we find that the frequency of work-based heavy drinking is positively related to newcomer alcohol misuse and mediates the positive relationship between performance drinking motives and newcomer alcohol misuse.",ok

In this study, we use a micro-level approach to provide a better understanding of why outside directors have difficulty in monitoring the CEO. We highlight that an important reason for this lies in the boardroom dynamics associated with (a) outside directors’ cognitive conflict with the CEO and (b) the chair’s leadership of the board. Our inductive analyses of video observations of board meetings in five Australian corporations revealed the importance of chair participative leadership during disagreement episodes in the boardroom. Follow-up in-depth interviews of board meeting participants highlighted the importance of psychological safety as a key mechanism explaining why participative board chairs appear so effective in dealing with board–CEO cognitive conflict. We corroborate these results with a second, large-scale survey study involving data on 310 outside directors from 64 Dutch boards. Whereas prior work has mostly focused on the chair’s relationship with the CEO, we instead highlight the importance of the chair’s role as the leader of the board and identify board psychological safety as an important element shaping director monitoring within the confines of the boardroom.",ok

After all, talking provides employees with an opportunity to make sense of the experience and to “let off steam.” We challenge this perspective, drawing on cognitive-motivational-relational theory to develop arguments that unfairness talk leads to emotions that reduce the employee’s ability to move on from the unfairness. We first tested these proposals in a three-wave, two-source field study of bus drivers (Study 1), then replicated our findings in a laboratory study (Study 2). In both studies, we found that unfairness talk was positively related to anger and negatively related to hope. Those emotions went on to have direct effects on forgiveness and indirect effects on citizenship behavior. Our results also show that the detrimental effects of unfairness talk were neutralized when the listener offered suggestions that reframed the unfair situation.

In a meta-analytic investigation including 4,114 workgroups and 21,745 individuals, we found that LMX differentiation was detrimental to collective harmony and solidarity, as indicated by a consistent negative relationship with emergent states and group processes. A theoretical integration of our predictions within an input–mediator–outcome model of group effectiveness revealed a more complex pattern of relationships with group performance. By simultaneously considering the proximal and distal nature of group outcomes, we found that emergent states and group processes not only mediated the negative indirect relationship, but also suppressed the positive direct relationship between LMX differentiation and group performance. These findings demonstrate the utility of an equity–equality framework for understanding LMX differentiation in workgroups and imply that there are tradeoffs associated with differentiation that must be considered when predicting group effectiveness criteria.",ok

Drawing from intergroup relations literatures, we theorize how and why the appointment of a minority-status CEO is likely to impact the amount of help that white male top managers provide to their fellow executives. We first explain how white male managers’ negatively biased perceptions of racial minority and female CEOs lead them to experience a diminished sense of organizational identification following the appointment of a minority-status CEO. We then examine how this diminished sense of organizational identification is likely to reduce white male managers’ general propensities to provide help to other executives at the firm. We finally consider how reduced identification might have especially strong negative implications for the amount of help that white male managers provide to colleagues who are racial minorities or women. Our results consistently support our theoretical expectations that, following the appointment of a female or racial minority CEO, white male top managers tend to experience a diminished sense of organizational identification, and, in turn, provide less help to colleagues, with this reduction particularly pronounced for help provided to minority-status colleagues.",ok

Building on prior work in competitive dynamics from the Austrian School perspective, we propose that imitation can be an effective means of staying ahead, even in the absence of mimetic social pressures. This is because the leader’s imitation of follower actions represents equilibrating moves to maintain the status quo in reaction to the disequilibrating actions that the follower undertakes to catch up with the leader. Furthermore, reduction of difference in competitive positioning between leader and follower serves the same purpose, and both imitation strategies are complementary. These effects of “action imitation” and “positioning imitation,” we argue, are moderated by the degree of environmental uncertainty, by the extent of the leader’s initial advantage, and by the difference between leader and follower capabilities. Our theoretical arguments are supported by an analysis of data on head-to-head boat races from the America’s Cup World Series. By developing mechanisms that take endogenous and exogenous contingencies of competitive interactions into account, this paper advances competitive dynamics as a predictive theory of performance outcomes.",ok

We investigate how politicians’ imprinted political ideologies affect the likelihood of firms’ political appointments. Examining 760 city mayors across 242 Chinese cities from 2001 to 2013, we find that cities have fewer private firms appointed to local councils if the mayor—the key decision maker for such appointments—is more strongly imprinted with an orthodox communist ideology that opposes capitalism. The intensity and evolution of such an ideological imprint are influenced by contextual factors. The imprint’s strength is shaped by the mayors’ prior exposure to intense ideological experiences, such as experiencing the Cultural Revolution at a young age. Working in an environment consistent with the ideology (e.g., a province with a greater communist legacy) sustains and even strengthens the imprint, whereas working in an environment inconsistent with the ideology (e.g., a city with greater economic development) attenuates it. We discuss the implications of these findings for political strategy research, imprinting theory, and nascent research on political ideology.",ok

Business organizations are central to this challenge, in that they support the production of escalating greenhouse gas emissions but also offer innovative ways to decarbonize our economies. In this paper, we examine how businesses respond to climate change. Based on five in-depth case studies of major Australian corporations over a 10-year period (2005–2015), we identify three key stages in the corporate translation of climate change: framing, localizing, and normalizing. We develop a grounded model that explains how the revolutionary import of grand challenges is converted into the mundane and comfortable concerns of “business as usual.” We find that critique is the major driver of this process by continuously revealing the tensions between the demands of the grand challenge and business imperatives. Our paper contributes to the literature on business and the natural environment by identifying how and why corporate environmental initiatives deteriorate over time.

To advance understanding of this process, I conducted an inductive study of temporary teams in four hospital emergency departments (EDs), and found that the teams in two EDs coordinated effectively, but the teams in the other two EDs did not. To theorize an explanation, I draw on the organizational justice literature and introduce the idea of justice enforceability, defined as the perception that authorities can act fairly, given the potential for other people to cheat. The team members’ perceptions of justice enforceability were focused on whether the distribution of work within and between teams was fair or could be cheated. When team members perceived that justice was enforceable, they were willing to engage in the extra-role behaviors that wove together their individual responsibilities. But when they perceived that cheating was possible, they avoided the extra-role behaviors that would have made them suckers for working hard while others cheated. Justice enforceability thus resolves a common tension in temporary teams, namely that the potential for uneven effort can undermine team coordination. In these ED teams, members only trusted that authorities could act fairly when the distribution of work was exactly equal; then team members felt they were all “in it together,” and each put in the work to coordinate as a team.",ok

We examine an important outcome created by agency risk—that agents pursue quantity of innovation at the expense of novelty—and investigate how it is influenced by corporate and public governance. We theorize that improved corporate governance tools, including better alignment of agents’ private incentives and stronger monitoring, and high-quality public governance reduce such agency risk in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Furthermore, higher-quality public governance enhances the functioning of corporate governance tools in further reducing such agency risk in innovation. We test our theory by examining SOEs in China that responded to the state’s pro-innovation policies relying disproportionately on quantifiable outcomes (e.g., patent counts) for assessing innovation performance. Our difference-in-differences estimates provide overall support for our hypotheses. These findings provide new insights on how agency risk affects innovation by distinguishing the consequences for quantity and novelty of innovation and for how conventional corporate governance tools shaping innovation depend on public governance.",ok

We develop a process model explaining how groups use temporal work to foster immersive episodes of engagement across transitions that are hard to control or predict. We show that broadening focus and compressing duration foster experiences of temporal control that enable engaging transitions into busy periods of work, whereas narrowing focus and extending duration foster experiences of immersive duration that enable satisfying transitions into idle periods. We develop a temporal perspective to engagement at work, showing how groups set the temporal context within which they encounter work episodes and how this context enables or constrains engagement.

Although many of these interpretations revolve around size, categorical distinctions between “small” and “large” firms pack concepts and ideas that extend significantly beyond a simple distinction based on size, and would be better understood as an organizational form distinction between specialist and generalist firms. Focusing on the organizational form of a specialist, we claim that two features of its form identity work against each other to influence turnover: employees of specialists realize that it is hard to develop careers internally (a push factor) but value the more relaxed environment, meaningful work, and flexibility of their jobs (a pull effect). We propose a theory to parse out the two effects, find empirical support for it in analyses of managerial turnover in the Korean TV advertising industry, and conclude that the construct of organizational form offers an opportunity to extend models of career mobility and individual turnover.",ok

Archival and experimental analyses inform our predictions. The former utilizes proprietary data on 1,335 startups graduating from European accelerators. Every accelerator holds a “Demo Day,” where startups pitch to investors. We find that graduating on a sunnier day increases the likelihood of investment.

Using qualitative and quantitative data on the mobility of jockeys in the Palio di Siena (1743–2011), the famous horse race in Siena, Italy, we document relational gaps in the mobility network—career moves that do not occur, even if expected on economic grounds. The analysis shows that rivalry constrains not only the moves to rivals but also to allies of rivals and rivals of allies. The effect becomes stronger over time, attesting that relational constraints persist in developed markets. Our fieldwork reveals that the constraining ability of rivalry is based on conformity to expectations of loyalty and adherence to group identities.

Despite the benefits of informal mechanisms of coordination for knowledge-based work, there is considerable ambiguity regarding their effects in MTSs. To resolve this ambiguity, we build and test theory about how interpersonal interactions among MTS members serve as an informal coordination mechanism that facilitates team and system functioning. Integrating MTS research with insights from the team boundary spanning literature, we argue that the degree to which MTS members balance their interactions with members of their own component team (i.e., intrateam interactions) and with the members of other teams in the system (i.e., interteam interactions) shapes team- and system-level performance. The findings of a multimethod study of 44 MTSs composed of 295 teams and 930 members show that as interteam interactions exceed intrateam interactions, team conflict arises and detracts from component team performance. At the system level, a balance between intrateam and interteam interactions enhances system success. Our findings advance understanding of MTSs by highlighting how informal coordination mechanisms enable MTSs to overcome their coordination challenges and address the unique performance tension between component teams and the larger system.",ok

In this research, I explore one implication of this shift—how employees respond to client conflicts. In a multi-method qualitative study, I studied patient advocates, hospital employees who mediate conflicts between patients, families, and staff. I develop a process model that shows how mediators construct a web of discrete social interactions that, over time, enables them to develop an empathetic account of the conflict. They then selectively deploy the account to engage in sensegiving. The process model integrates research on emotions and sensemaking in novel ways. I identify how emotion work triggers emotion dynamics in interactions that facilitate or disrupt sensemaking and sensegiving. I show how plausible accounts are developed over the course of social interactions and that mediators pivoted from sensemaking to sensegiving when the account was characterized by empathy. Overall, this research shows how mediators actively generate, interpret, and influence their own and others’ emotions, and that mediators’ emotion work contributes to the success of collective sensemaking.",ok

We argue that pluralistic value systems create multiple status conferral mechanisms, and that hierarchies’ prestige varies as a function of the values they represent. While status inconsistency, in general, increases the likelihood that actors will pursue opportunities that can boost their lagging status, their status hierarchies’ unequal prestige influences the magnitude and direction of actors’ responses to their status inconsistency. Further, their ability to respond is constrained by their relative standing in their primary status hierarchy and the extent to which they are embedded in particular professional networks. Using the artistic and commercial status of Hollywood performers, we found that status-inconsistent performers were more likely to appear in films that could boost their lagging status in the commercial hierarchy when they possessed relatively higher artistic than commercial status. Moreover, being high-status decreased the likelihood a performer would pursue opportunities that could improve their lagging status only when they were high status in the artistic status hierarchy, while embeddedness only decreased the likelihood when their primary status hierarchy was commercial.",ok

While prior research has considered the characteristics of the individuals generating project ideas, we shift the focus to the panel of selectors and explore how they shape the evaluation of novelty.

Based on studies conducted across a variety of work settings and spanning nearly 30 years, we found that the sex differences in rewards (d = .56) (including salary, bonuses, and promotions) were 14 times larger than sex differences in performance evaluations (d = .04), and that differences in performance evaluations did not explain reward differences between men and women. The percentage of men in an occupation and the complexity of jobs performed by employees enhanced the male–female gap in performance and rewards. In highly prestigious occupations, women performed equally, but were rewarded significantly lower than men. Only a higher representation of female executives at the industry level enabled women to reverse the gender gap in rewards and performance evaluations. Our configurational analysis also revealed that some occupation-, industry-, and job-level attributes of the work context jointly contributed to differences in rewards and performance evaluations.",ok

Although most mentors believe knowledge resides higher up in hierarchies, the current research demonstrates mentors are more engaged and effective when they value insights from below. Our first three studies found that downward learning predicted mentor engagement (Study 1) because downward learning-directed mentors viewed mentoring as a worthwhile opportunity for their own learning (Studies 2A and 2B). A field study examined downstream consequences on mentees’ learning outcomes, finding that downward learning-directed mentors trained more hireable mentees (Study 3). A final experiment established causality while also demonstrating that learning direction is open to intervention: reflecting on a downward learning experience increased mentor engagement, which enhanced the mentorship experience for their mentees (Study 4). We extend theories on learning orientation to learning direction and demonstrate that beliefs about the hierarchical sources of learning are critical to successful mentoring.",ok

Whereas studies have identified what these “dirty workers” think and do to maintain a positive work identity, it remains unclear why they do so whereas others tend to disengage from work. We draw from self-categorization theory to develop a model that conceptualizes how the salience of one’s social identity is determined jointly by engaging in dirty tasks (i.e., work dirtiness) and perceived occupational stigma. When perceiving that others in society stigmatize one’s occupation, high work dirtiness creates a match between one’s behavior and societal expectations linked to one’s job. Based on this mechanism of normative fit, work-related social identity is salient, encouraging pro-organizational behavior. Conversely, we argue that when stigma is perceived as low, individuals experiencing high dirtiness at work become more concerned about their personal identity, reducing engagement with their organization. Results from four studies using survey and experimental designs largely support our hypotheses. This research reconciles seemingly contradictory results concerning employee responses toward dirty work and provides a theoretical explanation for why people with dirty jobs engage positively with their work and organizations.",ok

In this paper, we shed light on this ideator’s bias, and examine when and why certain ideas are more prone to biased evaluations. Specifically, we argue that biased idea evaluations depend on the self-efficacy that ideators may derive from their specific role and social identity in the firm when generating a specific idea. We test our theoretical predictions of such a situation-specific perspective on overconfidence by using a corporate dataset on process innovations and their valuations. Furthermore, we triangulate our predicted mechanism and rule out alternative explanations through a series of additional interviews and four scenario-based experiments. Consistent with our situation-specific, identity-based account, we find that ideas from employees at a higher (vs. lower) organizational level, and from employees generating ideas in groups (vs. individually) are more prone to an ideator’s bias. In doing so, our study helps explain when the ideator’s bias prevails in a real-life organizational context, raises caution about some current proxies to identify high-potential ideas, and provides fresh insights to established theories around overconfidence and self-efficacy.",ok

In Study 1, using data from 327 teachers and their immediate supervisors, we found support for our hypotheses that perceived underemployment had an inverted U-shaped relationship with task crafting and that this relationship was moderated by organizational identification. When the teachers’ organizational identification was high, they engaged in more task crafting for the organization at intermediate levels of perceived underemployment. We also found that task crafting was positively related to creativity and organizational citizenship behavior.

Applying upper echelons and threat response perspectives, we propose that divergence between the national political climate and the CEO’s own ideology provokes a threat response, leading CEOs to cut research and development spending and increase retained earnings. We then examine two boundary conditions for this relationship. First, we propose that CEO wealth tied to the firm in the form of vested stock options will increase the perceived threat of ideology divergence, strengthening the threat response. Second, we propose that industry regulation will dampen the threat perceived from divergence, as well as hindering the CEO’s ability to respond to the threat at all, because of greater stability and lower discretion, respectively.

Employing a multicountry event study, we analyze how the stock markets in 11 eurozone countries react to the abstract language in public speeches delivered by the European Central Bank president. We find that abstract language, rather than creating common ground, produces divergent market reactions across core and peripheral countries, such that market actors in core countries react more favorably to abstract communication, while those in peripheral countries prefer concrete communication. We also show that this divergent reaction is stronger when the economic interests of the core and the periphery are made more salient.

Negative feedback fuels teams’ systematic effort and attention to external, novel information. In informationally diverse teams, in which members hold different information and perspectives, these efforts promote team creativity through information elaboration. Conversely, positive feedback propels members to flexibly use their information and contribute the resultant divergent insights to the team. In informationally homogeneous teams, wherein these insights relate to others’ information and perspectives, these divergent insights trigger teams’ generative processing and in turn creativity.

Once marriage equality is enacted, firms shift their speech toward activism, advocating for broader societal change. Further, the shift to activism is highly dependent on internal and external stakeholder preferences. Our findings point to an irony: corporate “activism” in pursuit of social change often takes place only after polarizing issues have been settled.

Simmelian brokers are trusted by their friends if they exhibit a role-appropriate diplomatic personality style involving flexibility of self-presentation (high self-monitoring) and inhibition of verbal loquaciousness (low blirtatiousness). Of course, not everyone engages in Simmelian brokerage. Some individuals experience a strongly cohesive situation—i.e., a single friendship clique within which they are embedded. For these nonbrokers, we hypothesized and found that the most appropriate trait combination likely to maintain the trust of a group of tightly bound colleagues involved a forthright, be-true-to-yourself, loquacious personality style (i.e., low self-monitoring, high blirtatiousness).

Specifically, I consider both the gender of the decision maker and the job of the employee being evaluated. The goal of this study is to determine whether male and female managers differ in how they use the discretion afforded by less formalized pay systems, and to identify the implications for pay among employees at different levels of the organizational hierarchy. Among 857 employees in 120 retail branches of a financial services firm, I find evidence of less gender pay inequality in terms of less formalized components of pay for employees reporting to a female manager. However, this effect is only among employees in the lowest organizational ranks. These findings demonstrate that it is critical to take manager gender and the organizational position of the employees being evaluated into account when assessing the relationship between the formalization of pay and gender pay inequality.",ok

In Study 1, we manipulate teams’ foci of identification (team vs. system focused) in a sample of 84 five-member teams working in one of 21 four-team multiteam systems performing a computer strategy simulation. We find that, while system-focused teams shared information equally with all teams, team-focused teams shared less information with system-focused teams than they did with other team-focused teams. Interteam information sharing positively predicted interteam performance. In Study 2, we test the assumptions underlying our theory in a vignette experiment, demonstrating that team-focused individuals adopt instrumental motives toward interteam interaction.

In a longitudinal qualitative study of entrepreneurial ventures over a one-year period, we uncovered a novel phenomenon: the creative jolt—an episode of cognitive and emotional upheaval through which creators let go of their original ideas and allowed new ones to emerge, so that their ideas shifted in dramatic ways.

However, existing studies have primarily focused on the macro-level human resource management architecture, limiting our understanding about the cross-level origin of innovation. Developing an emergence-based human resource management framework, we propose that an employee-experienced high-involvement work system (HIWS) promotes innovation by eliciting collective interactions for knowledge exchange and aggregation. Further, we investigate the emergence-enabling process that facilitates an employee-experienced HIWS to give rise to organization-level innovation. Specifically, we probe three distinct emergence enablers that amplify the positive influence of HIWS on innovation by shaping the concertedness, direction, and adaptability of collective interactions: (1) the homogeneity of HIWS experiences as the internal mechanism, (2) the strategic importance of innovation as the external mechanism, and (3) the churn in human resources as the temporal mechanism. We tested our theoretical model using data from a nationally representative sample of workplaces in Canada (n = 2,639). Our results suggest that an employee-experienced HIWS was positively related to innovation. In addition, this positive effect was amplified by all three emergence enablers (i.e., the homogeneity of HIWS experiences, the strategic importance of innovation, and the churn in human resources).",ok

Using the regulatory punctuation of pro-market reforms characterizing the Indian economy as the research context, I examine how the timing of firms’ founding (i.e., in the pre- or post-reform period) explains their intensity of research and development (R&D) search following negative attainment discrepancy in the post-reform period. Furthermore, I explore how this relationship varies on the basis of the protectionist policies that characterized the industries in which firms operated during their founding. Overall, I find that firms that originated in the pre-reform period engage in less R&D search in response to negative attainment discrepancy; furthermore, this behavior is stronger among firms that were founded in more protected industries. Post hoc tests, however, reveal that when firms that originated in the pre-reform period face existential threats, they tend to commit greater resources to R&D search. These findings contribute to research at the intersection of history, institutions, and problemistic search theory, and provide novel insights into the problemistic search behaviors of emerging-economy firms.",ok

Under uncertainty, acolytes (i.e., subordinates with work connections to high-reputation industry leaders) are likely to benefit in terms of signaling fitness for promotion in the external job market. Analysis of promotion outcomes of coaches in the National Football League over 31 years showed that the acolyte effect was reduced for individuals for whom uncertainty was lowest (acolytes with considerable industry experience or high centrality in the co-worker industry network). There was no support for either a knowledge-transfer or an intrinsic-quality explanation for why acolytes initially gained advantage. Rather, evidence supported the idea that ties to high-reputation leaders were somewhat randomly distributed so that acolytes faced ex post settling-up consequences after their promotions: i.e., fewer further promotions or lateral moves, and more demotions. Thus, acolytes initially benefited from loose linkages between their unobservable quality and signals offered by their industry-leader ties, but also suffered as the unreliability of social network signals became evident. The results suggest that a competitive job market may exhibit self-correction over time. We offer countervailing theory and evidence to the prevailing view that high-reputation third-party endorsements perpetuate a rich-get-richer social structure that is resistant to performance outcomes.",ok

Using extensive qualitative data, we develop a process model explaining how the introduction of a temporary regulation creates an opportunity for society to experience a counter-normative practice and learn from it. During this period, multiple institutional actors—while pursuing objectives far removed from considerations of institutional change—perform various types of institutional work to contain the practice’s expected negative outcomes. This institutional work unintendedly generates new societal understandings about the practice’s risks and consequences, which interested actors then leverage to achieve lasting institutional change. We advance institutional theory by identifying an unexplored path of institutional change through temporary regulations, demonstrating how temporary regulations can enable practice variations and institutional learning, and revealing how institutional maintenance work can drive change. Our insights suggest that temporary regulations can be valuable policy tools for reducing uncertainty and enabling learning about alternative institutional arrangements.",ok

We argue that the safeguards to limit opportunistic behavior by directly linked firms in a dyad, which have been the focus of extant research, are insufficient to overcome extra-dyadic leakage risks. Instead, firms terminate or avoid ties that expose their knowledge to indirectly linked rivals (“pruning” and “grafting”) and embed themselves in dense networks (“closing”) to prevent strategic knowledge spillover. Through a longitudinal study of German board interlocks during 1990–2003, we find that firms are more likely to prune, graft, and close their networks as they accumulate strategic knowledge and as the firms to which they are interlocked increasingly generate indirect ties to competitors, even when controlling for dyadic safeguards discussed by prior research. We capture strategic knowledge by tracking firms’ experience in the former Warsaw Pact countries from immediately after the sudden fall of communism in 1990 until 2003.

Through a longitudinal study of photography firms transitioning from analog to digital technologies, we examine a key source of heterogeneity: whether and how incumbents integrate knowledge related to both old and new technologies to bridge generations. Specifically, we explore how the use of three types of intergenerational knowledge bridges—(1) inventor bridges, (2) technology bridges, and (3) hybrid product bridges—influences inventive performance in the new generation. Consistent with theories of inertia, we find that, on average, inventor and technology bridges are associated with lower performance in the new generation. However, the strength of a firm’s inventive performance in the old generation positively moderates this effect. When performance in the old technology is strong, both technology and hybrid product bridges are associated with higher inventive performance in the new generation. This finding suggests that, when combined with a strong R&D program, old-technology knowledge forms a foundation that incumbents can leverage to learn new technologies as they navigate transitions.",ok

We further hypothesize that the duration of the discussion moderates these main effects. Analyses on 366 agenda items from 68 board meetings of four Dutch water management organizations support our predictions that board member emotional displays indeed impact strategic decision outcomes via focused and diffuse influence processes. Our results also suggest that the duration of an agenda item’s discussion attenuates the association between board members’ displayed anger and their focused influence.

Liberal CEOs will favor evenhandedness, while conservatives will tolerate greater disparities. Placing this primary expectation in a social context, we then argue that the effects of a CEO’s values are amplified when aligned with the prevailing ideology among organizational members, and conversely are muted when misaligned. Then, examining how instrumental incentives moderate the enactment of CEO values, we envision motivated cognition as a potent psychological process, which leads CEOs to “double down” on their personal values when they have more to gain or lose (when pay is more equity-based or the CEO has larger shareholdings). Finally, we consider the implications of our values-based framework for firm performance, arguing that evenhanded allocations are beneficial when organizational ideology is liberal, but harmful when the organization leans conservative.

Accordingly, we hypothesize that leaders that communicate visions of change can address this resistance by assuring followers that the essence of the organizational identity will remain unchanged—making their vision of change also a vision of continuity. In line with our proposition that collective continuity is valued because it serves an uncertainty-reduction function, such visions should be more predictive of vision effectiveness the higher follower work-related uncertainty.

To explore distant futures, we analyze the case of geoengineering, a set of planetary-scale technologies that have been proposed as solutions to the threat of climate change. Geoengineering has increasingly been treated as if it were a reality, despite continued controversy and the absence of any implementation. We find that societal-level imaginaries that were built on deeply held moral bases and cosmologies underpinned the conception of geoengineering, and that a dialectic process of discursive attempts to reconcile oppositional imaginaries increased the concreteness and credibility of geoengineering so that it has increasingly been treated as an “as-if” reality.

We develop an attention-based perspective on gender diversity and theorize that firms with relatively more women in senior management compared to their industry peers are likely to allocate fewer attentional resources, time, and effort toward internal diversity practices. This inadvertently hurts the recruitment of women at lower levels. We propose that one way to mitigate these adverse cross-level spillover effects is to ensure women’s substantive representation on committees responsible for overseeing and monitoring the firm’s diversity and hiring-related decision-making processes.

In this paper, we challenge the underlying assumption that distinctiveness necessarily counteracts the attainment of legitimacy and propose that distinctiveness can become a source of legitimacy. This proposition matters because it fundamentally alters the relationship between distinctiveness and resource acquisition from certain audiences. We build on these theoretical arguments to examine new ventures’ resource acquisition from crowdfunders, one of the most important audiences for new ventures. Analysis of 28,425 crowdfunding campaigns across 39 market categories strongly supports our arguments, showing that higher levels of distinctiveness lead to superior crowdfunding performance. We further demonstrate that the legitimating effect of distinctiveness intensifies under the absence of alternative sources of legitimacy.

Further, we position authenticity as a continuum, as individuals may temper their gender expression to elicit acceptance and express a gender that feels “authentic enough” as they contend with the impact of prevailing gender norms and expectations in the workplace.

Using a sample of 9,633 firm-year observations covering 2,224 listed companies in China, we find that, as a firm’s performance falls further below its aspiration level, it has larger abnormal entertainment spending, an implicit measure of bribery expenditure, but not higher R&D intensity.

We examined three dimensions of temporal framing: temporal vagueness (lack of clarity and completeness regarding timelines), temporal distance (length of the action timeline: proximal versus distal), and frequency (repetition of vagueness and distance cues). Based on analysis of 2,130 competitive action press releases of 28 duopoly firms from 14 industries, we found that the temporal framing dimensions, both individually and interactively, were related to the response speed of rivals.

By publicizing its investments and engaging in institutional activism, a SWF can signal the institutional quality of host countries to internationalizing firms, thus allowing them to overcome the well-known “lemons problem” in international decision-making. We examine the impact of a SWF’s signals on firms’ ownership choices in their foreign acquisitions. Our empirical analysis of Norway’s socially responsible SWF and firms from Norway and Sweden during 1998–2011 shows that firms are more likely to take larger commitments via full equity ownership in acquisitions in host countries where Norway’s SWF holds larger investments. The signaling effect of the SWF weakens for conational firms, suggesting that proximity to the signaler may generate alternative information channels that diminish the signaling value of foreign investments. Similarly, institutional harmonization enabled by intergovernmental organizations connecting the home and host countries weakens the signaling value of SWF investments. Our findings point to intermediary signaling by activist institutional investors and the salience of their signals for firms’ international decision-making.",ok

Policies and practices conceived in high-income countries for improving the lives of patients in low-income countries have been criticized as ineffective or harmful. We examine the impact of one such policy, the World Trade Organization’s 1994 Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which was partly justified by a claim that patents and other intellectual property protections would improve the availability of drugs for “neglected diseases” such as malaria and tuberculosis. There is little evidence associating TRIPS with clinical trials, patents, or trade-in drugs for these diseases. One explanation for this is that basic science is required as a prerequisite to drug development. We theorize, test for, and find evidence that TRIPS encouraged the time-consuming and complex development of managerial institutions required for basic science on neglected diseases. The results indicate an increase in basic science on neglected diseases and in applied science on nonneglected diseases as countries became TRIPS compliant. In newly TRIPS-compliant, low-income countries, scientists intensified basic research on locally relevant diseases. We call for the application of management theories to grand challenges, and to the evaluation of policies such as TRIPS.",ok

Relying on qualitative data from 74 individuals (61 chiefs of staff and 13 leaders), we develop a process of heedful challenging: the process of presenting alternative perspectives to someone in an individualized manner. In this process, the lower-power employee utilizes their knowledge of the leader and their understanding of how organizational issues are impacting employees to thoughtfully challenge the leader by presenting differing perspectives and illuminating the implications of their behavior. We articulate how one becomes a right-hand partner through this process, present the defining characteristics and drawbacks of being a right-hand partner, and describe instances when this process goes awry.

Our theoretical argument suggests that in anticipation of social interaction with a relatively high-status colleague, corporate directors tend to reflect on characteristics shared with that colleague, while avoiding thoughts about characteristics not shared. We explain how this pattern of cognition induces genuine positive feelings and admiration for the colleague, such that their interpersonal behaviors are less likely to appear as insincere attempts to curry favor, and thus more likely to engender influence. We further suggest that this pattern of cognition is especially valuable when interacting with relatively high-status colleagues who are demographically dissimilar from the focal actor. Finally, our theoretical framework indicates how this self-regulated cognition facilitates advancement in the corporate elite by positively moderating the effects of one’s interpersonal behavior on the likelihood that colleagues will recommend him or her for a board appointment.

Their practices have generated strong criticisms from a police force unsure how to engage them because they lack an empathic understanding of hunters’ lived experience. Through a three-year phenomenological ethnography of a U.K. hunting team, we advance efforts across organization research to theorize the role of lived experience in social action. Specifically, we deploy the phenomenological concept “way-of-being” to explain hunters’ use of extreme practices. Our interpretive account shows how the multiple ways-of-being that characterize the team’s lifeworld suffuse their practices with a complex layered affectivity that is constitutive of the commitment necessary for their persistence. This offers a phenomenological alternative to social psychological models of motivations for vigilantism while also advancing emotions research in organizational institutionalism and practice theory. Practically, our study contributes to the policing challenge of mitigating hunting’s harmful effects by facilitating more constructive mutual engagement. This offers a possible pathway for addressing the broader challenge posed by epistemically closed, social media–enabled communities that act out their concerns in ways that disregard our common humanity.",ok

However, as prior studies have examined different facets of attention, a theoretical tension has emerged as to whether attention to a broader or narrower set of strategic issues better facilitates firm performance. On the one hand, a narrower breadth of strategic attention limits the risk of managerial cognitive overload. On the other hand, a greater breadth of strategic attention helps managers avoid blind spots and identify more or better opportunities. We argue that this balance shifts based on the quantity and quality of opportunities available in the market and on firms’ recently demonstrated ability to execute against these opportunities effectively and efficiently. Using a novel text-analysis tool that we develop, validate, and make available, we find support for our arguments within a random sample of Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 companies. We find that broader strategic attention is associated with enhanced performance in weaker opportunity environments, with firms using their resources efficiently, or with firms’ failure to utilize their capabilities effectively. In supplementary analyses, we also provide new insights into the importance of following attention with subsequent organizational action.",ok

Yet, while many studies have examined how microfinance loans affect poor borrowers, we know little about how microfinance organizations (MFOs) themselves finance their lending activities. This is a significant oversight because most MFOs do not self-fund their lending, but, rather, rely on loans from external funders. To better understand microfinance funding, we apply and extend the institutional logics perspective to analyze the lending practices of commercial and public funders, who together provide most of the capital for global microfinance. We argue that these funders adhere to financial and development logics, respectively, and that this leads them to invest in different types of MFOs. Yet, in the face of uncertainty, we suggest that the practices motivated by these logics will start to converge in ways that are problematic for a nation’s microfinance sector. Using a proprietary database of all traceable loans to MFOs from 2004 to 2012, we find strong support for our hypotheses. In particular, our findings show that the relationship between institutional logics and organizational practices is contextually contingent, and this insight contributes important understanding about the efficacy of microfinance as a poverty-reduction tool.",ok

In conformity with our predictions, these relationships were stronger in areas where the rate of institutional change was higher and for product types that took longer to develop. Thus, we explain why, for particular strategic actions, high risk may be associated with low returns. A key conceptual corollary of these findings—and for strategic management research in general—is that firms may sometimes be more focused on the potential upside of their actions than on the expected value of those actions.",ok

How might transgressors attempt to reintegrate and feel like full organizational insiders once again? And what makes transgressors feel more, or less, reintegrated? Previous work has studied reintegration from victims’ or third-parties’ perspectives, but little is known about transgressor reintegration. To build theory on transgressor reintegration, I studied transgressors at a military service academy. Through waves of qualitative data collection and inductive analyses, I find that transgressions threaten transgressors’ integration, leading transgressors to feel precarious in their perceptions of membership and their feelings of belonging. Transgressors attempt to restore both elements, but use distinct approaches for each. Because belonging restoration requires positive interactions with many organizational actors, transgressors can—and, in my data, frequently do—experience restoration of membership but not belonging. Therefore, it may be relatively rare for transgressors to feel highly reintegrated following transgressions, even in organizations that devote considerable resources to reintegration.",ok

Drawing from resource dependence theory and an empirical study of tie formation between developers and publishers of PlayStation 2 video games, we develop and test a framework that identifies the key decision variables and focuses on two moderators—resource need evolution and resource uncertainty related to competition—that explain whether a big fish (more development help) or a big pond (more market access) drives tie formation.

We develop a theoretical model of relational reconciliation that traces how agents engage with this identity threat in an ongoing, stumbling process. Through relational reconciliation, agents come to redefine their selves in relation to their “socializees,” which enables them to engage in elaborated socialization practices that aim to meet the needs of both the organization and the socializee. Our work repositions socialization agents as active parties in socialization, explores the tensions of socializing members of marginalized groups into a dominant culture, and reveals the importance of engaging with one’s own identities to reconcile these tensions.",ok

Drawing on family systems theory, we delineate five couple configurations using two dimensions to describe how couples promote togetherness or separateness (cohesion) and how couples balance stability and change in enacting roles (adjustability). Extreme adjustability (very high or very low) is problematic for resilience; this describes both chaotic (low cohesion, high adjustability) and rigid (low cohesion, low adjustability) couples. Extreme cohesion (very high or very low), in contrast, undermines organizational commitment; this describes enmeshed (high cohesion, moderate adjustability), chaotic, and rigid couples. In contrast, balanced couples (moderate cohesion, moderate adjustability) are both resilient and committed in this organization.

Using data from the U.S. lobbying industry and novel empirical estimates of worker–firm fit, we provide descriptive evidence that employee utilization (performance) decreases post-mobility, consistent with the portability paradox. However, this relationship attenuates—in magnitude and duration—when there is human capital resource complementarity (but not similarity) between the employee and hiring firm or when the employee transfers social capital resources (internal or external). We also find some evidence that human capital and social capital function as substitutes, and post hoc analyses suggest the characteristics of human and social capital which facilitate the utilization of external hires also correlate with hiring firm performance.",ok

This theoretical separation allows us to hypothesize the factors that affect the degree to which both of these elements of the contamination process occurs. Specifically, we predict that characteristics of the misconduct firm or event—factors that lend to investors' familiarity with the misconduct firms, or that prompt attributions of blame for the misconduct—affect the potency of the generalization of culpability to the industry, while characteristics of the industry bystander firms—investors' familiarity with such firms, or factors that lend to investors' perceptions that they have strong governance—affect the firms' vulnerability to being perceived as instantiating the generalized culpability.

We then measure these in a product innovation context to test for the performance effect of real options logic vis-à-vis its alternatives. Sequencing, which distinguishes dynamic allocation regimes more generally, is associated with higher new product sales. Low initial commitment and reallocation do not show individual direct effects on new product sales. However, when assessed as a match, we find that the fit between low initial commitment and reallocation (yes–yes; no–no) increases performance significantly. After controlling for such fit as well as sequencing, we find no significant performance difference between real options logic and other regimes. Our findings imply that insufficient identification of real options logic picks up confounding effects, which may provide an explanation for the inconclusive results in prior studies of real options and performance. In addition to bounding the concept more precisely, we contribute to theory by situating real options logic within the broader set of allocation regimes conducive to innovation performance in uncertain, competitive markets.",ok

Analyzing 1,251 realized matches and 12,510 nonrealized matches among knowledge providers and problems posted over a 32-month period on an online discussion forum within a global engineering firm, we find evidence to support our claim that attention allocation is driven by the features of a particular provider–problem match, thereby shifting the discourse from knowledge provider–seeker relationships to knowledge provider–problem matches.

In this study, we extend stewardship and agency theories to test competing propositions about the impact of family on employment practices using data from 14,961 private Belgian firms over a 19-year period. Higher investments, lower dividend payout, and higher risk tolerance indicate that family firms are better financial stewards of their companies than nonfamily firms. However, family firms are worse organizational stewards than nonfamily firms: they offer lower compensation, invest less in employee training, and exhibit higher voluntary turnover and lower labor productivity. Further, and contrary to earlier research, we find that financial practices in private family firms do not change over time, and that the deleterious influence of family on employment practices rises with both firm age and with heightened family involvement. Together, our findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of stewardship and agency theory is needed to understand the impact of family on the governance of private firms.",ok

Accordingly, in these situations, organizational leaders will announce the focal event contemporaneously with positive, but unrelated information. We predict impression offsetting will generally occur in the context of acquisitions, but also more frequently for specific acquiring firms and acquisitions that are more likely to lead to an expectancy violation. We also posit that offsetting will effectively inhibit observers’ perceptions of events as negative expectancy violations by positively influencing shareholder reactions to acquisition announcements. Consistent with our hypotheses, in a sample of publicly traded acquisition targets, we find evidence for impression offsetting, in which characteristics of both acquirers and their announced acquisitions predict its frequency of use. We also find evidence that impression offsetting is efficacious; on average, it reduces the negative market reaction to acquisition announcements by over 40%, which translates into approximately $246 million in market capitalization.",ok

Received wisdom is twofold: evaluators prefer White leaders because they possess prototypical leader traits; however, during periods of decline, evaluators prefer racial minority leaders because their stereotypical traits (e.g., warmth) position them to galvanize followers. We argue that whereas LCT is useful for explaining racial bias in nonsuccession contexts, it is insufficient for explaining racial bias during succession. During succession, evaluators focus on the predecessor as the comparison point when evaluating candidates. This causes stereotypes and prototypes to fade from evaluators’ minds, only to be replaced by a different racial bias—racial transference—which occurs when evaluators falsely assume that a leader candidate has the same personality traits as a racially similar predecessor, and thus will perform similarly. Consequently, evaluators select (reject) candidates who are racially similar to successful (unsuccessful) predecessors. We find support for these predictions in an archival study, a preregistered experiment, and three supplementary studies. Altogether, theory on racial transference establishes that racial bias during succession is driven by evaluators’ tendency to generalize between racially similar predecessors and candidates, even if such generalizations are inconsistent with prevailing stereotypes and prototypes.",ok

Although new ventures are often advised to be highly adaptive, we find that repeated pivoting introduces relational liabilities for even highly flexible organizations.

Empirical evidence from the global semiconductor manufacturing industry shows that convergence in both technological and customer competences decreases entrants’ survival chances, whereas a lack of convergence in any one of the two types of competence—that is, in one set of competences or another but not in both—gives entrants sufficient room to gain a foothold in the industry and to potentially disrupt incumbents. As a strategic response to disruption, multiplant industry incumbents can reposition themselves by changing their focus across submarkets while not necessarily exiting the industry entirely.

I identify three gender gap lay theories, which differ in the implied locus and control women have over the gap. These attributions shape women’s perceived responsibility, which, in turn, undermines diversity initiative support. Attributing the gap to organizational barriers is positively associated with diversity support because it implies the causes are external and uncontrollable by women. Attributing the gap to dispositional factors (e.g., traits) is negatively associated with diversity support because it implies the causes are internal to women (but not necessarily controllable). Finally, attributing the gap to women’s personal choices is negatively associated with diversity support because it implies the causes are both internal to and controllable by women; thus, it is most undermining overall. I test these ideas in five multimethod studies, which generally support my theory. I also find gender gaps are attributed to personal choice more than racial gaps are. Overall, this project suggests that, beyond demographics and ideology, sensemaking about the causes of gender inequality and, in particular, the belief that it is due to personal choice, significantly undermines diversity support.",ok

We reveal how a delicate tension between social pressure (to display vulnerabilities) and social support (to contain them) underpins these practices, and how this tension is influenced by power relations associated with multidisciplinarity. We show how participants’ appraisals of past episodes shape their willingness to engage in subsequent episodes, reinforcing or undermining the capacity of the setting to serve as a “holding environment” offering interpretation and containment.

Although this is conceptually intriguing only if different types of reputation produce different effects, concurrent tests of such differences are rare. In response, we study the effects of multiple reputations for bad behavior on the media coverage of a serious error by a firm. Due to the need for the news to be new, we predict the media is more likely to cover errors that supplement a firm’s general character reputation, but will likely ignore errors that are redundant given a firm’s specific capability reputation. We test this theory in the context of 113 major oil spills in the United States, from 1985 to 2016. Results confirm the theorized contrasting effects. Counterintuitively, we also find the media is even less likely to cover repeat offenders that cause larger spills.

Based on a longitudinal study of Nokia from 2007 to 2013, we develop a process model of socially distributed emotion regulation. This model shows how various organizational groups help regulate top managers’ emotions. Top managers contain their initial emotional reactions to strategic options thanks to activities performed by groups with power over top managers. This enables top managers to form data-informed reappraisals of strategic options, contributing to gradual changes in their emotions. The reappraisal process is aided by diverse groups performing distinct roles. Top managers’ revised emotions, in turn, enable them to form new, iterative data-informed reappraisals and ultimately enable radical strategic change. Our study contributes to research on emotions and strategy making by showing how socially distributed emotion regulation operates during strategy making and influences its outcomes. We contribute to the cognitive perspective on strategy by showing how cognition and emotion interact over time during strategy making.",ok

However, upon considering how justice behaviors influence subordinates’ cognitive processes, we predict that interpersonal justice has a surprising, unintended negative consequence. Supervisors who violate interpersonal justice rules trigger subordinates to search for reasons why their supervisors are threatening them, causing subordinates to be more attuned to supervisors’ individual characteristics and therefore unlikely to use stereotypes when evaluating them. In contrast, supervisors who adhere to interpersonal justice rules allow subordinates to divert attention away from them, leading subordinates’ judgments of their supervisors to be influenced by stereotypes. Consistent with these predictions, using field data we found that minority supervisors faced bias relative to Caucasian supervisors when supervisors adhered to—but not when they violated—interpersonal justice rules. We replicated this effect in an experiment and established that it is explained by an alternating pattern of stereotype application and inhibition: the stereotype that minority supervisors are more deceitful than Caucasians influenced fairness judgments when supervisors adhered to—but not when they violated—interpersonal justice rules. We then conducted exploratory analyses and identified one factor (unit size) that mitigates this troubling pattern.",ok

To address this shortcoming, we conducted a multistudy investigation. In Study 1, we interviewed 38 women about their daily experiences surrounding breastfeeding at work. We then developed a theoretical model to examine possible challenges and benefits associated with this blended work–family experience and tested it with an experience sampling investigation assessing 106 women over 15 workdays in Study 2. Results suggested that breastfeeding interference increased negative affect and decreased positive affect daily, with negative affect hindering breastfeeding goal progress (i.e., ounces of breast milk produced at work) and work goal progress. However, positive experiences tied to breastfeeding enrichment decreased negative affect and increased positive affect, with positive affect increasing work–family balance satisfaction. Beyond these relationships, we explored effects associated with contextual features of breastfeeding at work—breastfeeding stigma, breastfeeding compassion, and quality of the breastfeeding space. Combined, our work enhances theoretical understanding of blended work–family experiences, highlighting that blending work and family roles daily can yield both positive and negative consequences across domains.",ok

In two experiments and one field study, we find that amplification enhances status both for voicers and for those who amplify voice. Being amplified was equally beneficial for voicers who framed their ideas promotively and prohibitively (improvement-focused and problem-focused, respectively; Study 1), and for men and women (Study 2). Furthermore, amplified ideas were rated as higher quality than nonamplified ideas. Amplification also helped amplifiers: participants reading experimentally manipulated meeting transcripts rated amplifiers as higher status than those who self-promoted, stayed quiet, or contributed additional ideas (Studies 1 and 2). Finally, in an intervention in a nonprofit organization, select employees trained to use amplification attained higher status in their work groups (Study 3). Overall, these results increase our understanding of how social actors can capitalize on instances of voice to give a status boost to voicers who might otherwise be overlooked, and help organizations realize the potential of employees’ diverse perspectives.",ok

We integrate the economic principle of supply and demand with theory from the field of strategic human resource management and theorize that individuals perceive high-potential women—who have the abilities needed to reach the upper echelons of organizations, where women remain underrepresented—as more valuable for achieving organizational diversity goals than high-potential men and, in turn, reward them with higher pay. Two field studies (Studies 1 and 3) and two laboratory experiments (Studies 2 and 4) reveal a female premium that is unique to high-potential women (Studies 1 and 2), driven by perceptions that high-potential women have more diversity value than high-potential men (Studies 2 and 4), and larger in contexts where diversity goals are stronger (Studies 3 and 4).

In this paper, we intend to fill this gap by explicitly differentiating between the effects of diversity in TMTs and MMTs. By matching various firm-level and individual-level datasets, we compile a linked employer–employee panel dataset for Sweden for the period 2004–2012. Focusing on measures of educational diversity, we find that the effects differ considerably between MMTs and TMTs. TMTs’ diversity determines whether firms engage in innovation activities at all, while MMTs’ diversity affects the actual outcome of innovation processes, in particular successful product innovations and their degree of market novelty.",ok

This study examines cultural and symbolic strategies used to mitigate such risks by managing the emergence of multiple identities. A key strategic choice is “naming;” the parent’s name may be included in the new subsidiary’s name (“semantic seeding”) or not (“semantic autonomy”). A stock of parent–subsidiary names serves as a lens through which gatekeepers evaluate the parent’s underlying creativity at the time of spanning categories. There is expected to be interfirm variance in creativity evaluations due to the differences in the number of autonomous or seeded names a parent sustains, the degree of visibility of different names, and the timing of introducing a new name. Using a panel dataset of global high-end fashion houses between 1998 and 2010, we found that each new autonomous subsidiary name enhanced the parent’s creativity appeal up to a certain point (an inverted U-shaped relationship). However, the predicted negative linear effect of seeded subsidiary names was not supported. Furthermore, gatekeepers’ ongoing memory of the focal firm was found to influence the parent’s perceived creativity.

Yet research has overlooked how temporality, as a negotiated organizing of time, shapes institutional processes, despite the fact that timing, duration, and tenor of relationships are their foundational elements. To unpack the role of temporality in institutions, we examine how actors engage in temporal institutional work—that is, how they construct, navigate, and capitalize on timing norms in their attempts to change institutions. We draw on an inductive study of an institutional project to establish a novel foundation-based university that subsequently came to pace major statewide university reform. We identify three forms of temporal institutional work: entraining—as a top-down, routinized, reproductive form—and constructing urgency, and enacting momentum—both as bottom-up, issue-driven and generative forms. We show that by engaging in these types of work, actors produce windows of opportunity, synchronicity, and irreversibility as shared beliefs of temporality. These beliefs, in turn, shape how the wider institutional change unfolds. Our study shows that temporal institutional work enables institutional change. We discuss the implications for reconceptualizing institutional research from a temporal perspective.",ok

Integrating an institutional perspective with signaling theory, our core argument is that offline seller characteristics that are visible online—in particular, geographic location and legal status—convey credible signals of seller behavior because they provide buyers with information on sellers’ local institutional quality and the institutionally induced obligations and controls acting on sellers. Using unique data from a large, Italian, online B2B marketplace between the fourth quarter of 1999 and July 2001, we find that both sellers’ local institutional quality and their legal statuses affect a buyer’s likelihood of contacting a seller. Moreover, consistent with the idea that a buyer’s own local institutional quality generates a relevant reference point against which sellers are evaluated, we find that a buyer is progressively more likely to contact sellers the higher their local institutional quality relative to the buyer. Jointly, our findings imply that, in online B2B marketplaces, signals conveyed by sellers’ geographic locations and legal statuses may constitute substantive sources of competitive heterogeneity and market segmentation.",ok

We build on the dynamic strategic renewal literature, combine it with upper echelons theory insights, and integrate knowledge about female executives’ career strategies to theorize how and when female appointments into top management teams (TMTs) cause firms to change their approach to knowledge-related strategic renewal. In doing so, we reconcile the tension among extant mediating processes invoked to explain how female TMT representation might affect strategic decisions: change orientation and risk-taking propensity. Estimating a dynamic ordinary least squares model on panel data from 163 multinationals, we find that following female (but not male) TMT appointments, TMT cognitions shift, becoming more change oriented and less risk seeking. Subsequently, these TMT cognitive shifts cause a decrease in mergers and acquisitions and an increase in research and development. Our model of female TMT appointments as catalysts that cause shifts in TMT cognitions, which, in turn, redirect knowledge-related strategic renewal from a buying to a building approach, is a novel effort at advancing research on women at upper echelons to examine time-dependent, within-firm mechanisms linking women in upper echelons and firm outcomes.",ok

In a laboratory experiment (Study 1), undergraduate students whose values ostensibly differed from those of other discussion group members and the university administration created more facades when they perceived the discussion group leader as having high integrity. A two-wave survey of employed adults (Study 2) replicated the moderation effect and also revealed negative effects of facade creation on work engagement. In both studies, our results indicate that, ironically, when leader integrity is high, the tendency to create facades of conformity in response to low values congruence is magnified. Additionally, our findings reveal that positive attributes in leaders may not always result in positive responses from followers. The results from our study also show that facades of conformity may serve as a partial explanatory mechanism in the relationship between values congruence and employee engagement.",ok

On the one hand, maintaining commitments to transgressors poses negative spillover risks, so theories posit firms are more likely to avoid such risks by ending commitments as negative spillover rises. On the other hand, exchange relationships often create embedded value, so theorizing also posits firms are more likely to avoid risking loss by maintaining commitments as relationships are more embedded. We argue this “maintain or end” choice oversimplifies a complex situation in which there are mixed gambles (i.e., choices offering both positive and negative outcomes). We integrate theorizing on mixed gambles and negative spillover to develop a broader conceptualization of alternative strategies for firms to reconcile these risk trade-offs beyond a binary “maintain or end” reaction, theorizing firms may: (a) increase or decrease commitments to transgressors, (b) hedge against risks by adding new partners while maintaining existing ones, or (c) “boomerang” by restarting exchange after previously ending commitments. Using firms’ relationships with politicians accused of misconduct to test our arguments, findings support our theorizing.

Drawing on executive job demands theory, we argue that incumbent CEOs feel burdened by both types of unrest, leading them to voluntarily depart, and that new CEOs of unrest-laden firms receive larger pay packages as compensation for dealing with these inherited job demands. Overarching all these expectations, we argue that the effects of CSR-oriented unrest will be greater than the effects of wealth-oriented unrest, as CSR-oriented unrest occurs in a domain where alternative performance indicators are few and noisy, causing CSR-oriented unrest to be seemingly more meaningful.

We ask whether, in the context of competition, people seek to identify the knowledge providers of their rivals while striving to hide their own knowledge providers from perceived rivals. We conducted two experiments that showed, for the first time, that structural equivalence does induce feelings of rivalry and does lead people to take action with respect to perceived rivals, namely to hide and seek knowledge providers. Our analysis of time-separated social network and outcome data from all 73 employees in the headquarters of a chemical company found support for these patterns of hiding and seeking in relation to perceived rivals.

We observed two projects in which researchers and managers collaborated to generate knowledge related to business sustainability, and conducted 67 interviews with 47 participants in similar projects. We found that, by making the process explicit, participants were better able to cocreate knowledge. Furthermore, we identified two devices that helped to make the process explicit: (1) making temporal connections between events and (2) recognizing the incompleteness of the objects.

Building on previous findings regarding the motivational and informational effects of rewards, we use social identity theory to predict that different types of inventors react differently to such false positive and false negative information. Specifically, we hypothesize that PFP that produces false positives has detrimental effects on corporate inventors with a taste for science, who are motivated by scientific prestige, reputation, and intellectual curiosity. The empirical results from survey data related to 3,995 inventor–patent pairs show that, for this particular group of inventors, false positives are associated with reduced effort in research activities and fewer interactions with peers in the R&D department.

Taking the perspective of the disconnected firms to whom the broker is tied, the “alters,” we argue that structurally induced “inequity” in opportunity, or the broker’s potential recombination of a larger share of alters’ knowledge than vice versa, exerts a destabilizing effect on brokerage persistence. Furthermore, geographic distance, via its role in the cognitive classification of rivals, enhances alters’ tolerance for inequity and contingently weakens the destabilizing effect of structural inequity in knowledge recombination opportunity that benefits the broker. Specifically, we postulate about the sociocognitive prismatic nature of geography in that geographic distance makes it less likely that alter firms see the broker as a rival and are hence less sensitive to inequity. We test our hypotheses with 260 broker and 517 alter firms in the global biopharmaceutical industry from 1985 to 2005, yielding 53,377 triad-year observations using a complementary log-log discrete time survival estimator. Our results support the hypotheses, highlighting the interplay between structural inequity and geographic distance in explaining brokerage decay.",ok

We test our model using multisource data collected from active soldiers in the United States Army. Results reveal that parental income exerts indirect effects on leadership effectiveness criteria because (a) parental income is positively related to narcissism as an adult, (b) narcissism relates negatively to engaging in task-, relational-, and change-oriented leadership behaviors, and (c) reduced engagement in these behaviors relates to lower leader effectiveness. Our investigation advances theory by identifying pathways through which parental income relates to the effectiveness of leaders in organizations, and by illuminating the origins of a trait—narcissism—that predicts the behavior and effectiveness of leaders.",ok

We advance work–family research by integrating balance theory with the interrole conflict literature to investigate dyadic interrole conflict congruence and challenge the implicit assumption that less interrole conflict always results in superior outcomes. Using a polynomial regression analysis of 141 employee and romantic partner dyads, we demonstrate that congruence between couples’ experiences of family-to-work (but not work-to-family) conflict is positively associated with balance satisfaction, and ultimately employee job satisfaction and partner relationship satisfaction. Thus, when it comes to balance satisfaction and its downstream correlates, the harmful effects of high family-to-work conflict (FWC) are largely mitigated if an employee’s partner shares a similarly high level of FWC, and the beneficial effects of low FWC are largely eliminated if an employee’s partner does not share a similarly low level of FWC.",ok

We integrate signaling theory to extend this work, positing that signals of managers’ willingness to support subordinates’ advancement shapes which opportunities employees throughout the firm choose to pursue.

Our primary setting for investigating this proposition is the privatization of Chinese firms. We argue that massive layoffs resulting from privatization triggered guilt among firm leaders to drive corporate philanthropy. The analysis of a national survey of Chinese private firms shows that on average privatized firms made approximately 26% more charitable contributions than firms founded as private. This was particularly the case when (a) privatization resulted in layoffs (vs. no layoffs), (b) the firms’ provinces experienced greater unemployment at the time of privatization, (c) the firms’ leaders were directly involved in privatization, (d) the influence of Confucianism was stronger in their provinces, and (e) firm leaders had stronger ties with laid-off workers. An interview-based field study of 25 firm leaders involved in privatization provides qualitative evidence of the influence of guilt on privatized firms’ philanthropy. Finally, a vignette experiment conducted on EMBA students shows the mediation of guilt between privatization and firms’ philanthropic intention.

Studies abound on how categories emerge and become established, or fall out of use. Yet, extant research has often examined the evolution of categories one at a time, leaving open the question of how related categories affect a focal category’s viability. In contrast, we consider both intra- and inter-category dynamics. Viewing categories as continuously shaped by actors’ efforts to position their products, we argue that these efforts alter the coherence that products exhibit not only within a category (a category’s heterogeneity), but also across related categories (a category’s distinctiveness). We theorize how the interaction between a category’s heterogeneity and distinctiveness shapes its subsequent viability. When a focal category’s distinctiveness is low, the heterogeneity–viability relationship takes an inverted U-shape. However, as distinctiveness grows, the relationship flattens and eventually flips to a U-shape. We explain this by considering the trade-off between the “classification” and “valuation” benefits that a category affords. We find support for our argument by tracking 170 categories over an 11-year period on Kickstarter, one of the largest crowdfunding platforms. By providing a nuanced understanding of category dynamics, we shed new light onto the fluctuating viability of categories.",ok

When routines are represented as a narrative network, tracing the formation and dissolution of action paths can generate new insights about the dynamic patterning of actions in routine performances. We traced action paths using longitudinal field data from a videogame development project, and found that action patterns change dramatically over time based on the needs of the project. We explain these changes in terms of generic mechanisms that lead to the enactment of more (or fewer) paths in the narrative network. We propose that patterning can be seen as a new motor of routine dynamics and discuss generic mechanisms through which patterning can influence narrative network structure.",ok

The results revealed that, compared to non-nominees, nonwinner nominees have lower collaboration responsiveness to winners following the award announcement, especially when they have a higher structural proximity to winners. However, in the long run, nonwinner nominees have higher collaboration responsiveness to others in general. Furthermore, being nominated for but failing to receive an award simultaneously induces nonwinner nominees to experience higher causal-inference counterfactual thinking and negative affect, which exert opposing impacts on nonwinner nominees’ collaboration responsiveness.

This matters because such adoptions facilitate growth and adaptation, and the literature hints that the structure will affect the adoption process. To explore these issues, we conducted an inductive, qualitative study of hybrid entrepreneurs (specifically, academic entrepreneurs). Our findings reveal that individuals combine four dimensions (depth, overlap, density, and range) to create one of three cognitive structures (hierarchical, integrative, or web), and that high levels of one dimension may preclude high levels of certain others. Further, we develop a model of how these structures impact the adoption of a new identity by focusing attention on some dimensions while limiting attention to others. In doing so, they guide individuals into a unique adoption path involving a certain need that identity adoption satisfies by serving a particular function in the network. This function influences the logic used in determining whether the new identity becomes stabilized in the network. Thus, our theory contributes to the literatures on multiple identities and hybrid entrepreneurs.",ok

In this way, the changing nature of work provides a potential paradox: it can simultaneously increase social distance between coworkers while potentially decreasing that distance by providing a vivid and unfiltered glimpse into their nonwork lives. Extending social penetration theory, we use a multimethod approach including experimental studies and surveys to examine how three dimensions of coworker learning—learning that is (1) more vivid, (2) perceived as unintentional, and (3) about a coworker’s nonwork life—lead an employee to view that coworker as more authentic, trustworthy, and human.

We conducted a qualitative study of 73 Tanzanian participants who had both a self-employed work role and a family planning counselor community role.

Across multiple studies employing archival field data, controlled lab experiments, and different instantiations of dominance, prestige, and misconduct, we consistently demonstrate that high-status dominant actors are punished more harshly than their prestigious counterparts. Further, we find that attributions of intentionality and lack of moral credentials explain the harsher punishments meted out to dominant (vs. prestigious) high-status actors.

This nonlinear relationship, we argue, is moderated by the breadth, depth, and focus of the focal organization’s resource accumulation and allocation patterns. While horizontal scope (i.e., increased breadth) and an externally oriented resource profile (i.e., reduced depth) strengthen the relationship, market orientation (i.e., increased focus) attenuates it. We test and find strong support for our hypotheses using population data on French film production firms from 1998 to 2008. Our work highlights the performance trade-offs associated with public sponsorship, and carries important managerial and policy implications.",ok

We complement this line of work by exploring how scandals durably affect competition within a field, translating into relative advantages for certain organizations over others. First, scandals may benefit organizations that provide a close substitute to the offerings of the implicated organization. Second, scandals pave the way for moralizing discourses and practices, shake taken-for-granted assumptions about the conduct of organizations, and result in a shift in criteria used to evaluate organizations within the field. Our arguments suggest that organizations whose offerings are most similar to those of the implicated organization, yet are perceived as enforcing stricter standards of conduct, are likely to benefit the most from a scandal. We find support for these arguments in a county-level study of membership in the Catholic Church and 16 other Christian denominations in the United States in the wake of a series of sex abuse cases perpetrated by Catholic clergy between 1971 and 2000. This study contributes to our understanding of the competitive effects of scandals on organizations, and carries important implications for the management of organizations in scandal-stricken fields.",ok

Based on strategic human resource management research, we introduce contingency theory to examine whether external (industry characteristics) and internal (prior firm performance and collective turnover) environments affect the use of selection practices, how the adoption of selection practices relates to subsequent firm performance, and whether the external (industry) and internal (selection stages and collective turnover) environments moderate the selection–performance relationship. Using a sample of 413 firms, we found that firms use more selection practices when there is less collective turnover and when firms are within low-growth and stable industries. The results also show that firms employing more selection practices generated greater productivity but not profit. Positive effects occur when firms have less collective turnover and are within dynamic industries but, surprisingly, the effects of selection on performance can actually be negative in stable industries. These findings provide new insights about the strategic value of personnel selection; one that is sensitive to and contingent upon competitive environments.",ok

Seeking to understand this empirical puzzle, I drew on the concept of abduction from pragmatism and organizational studies. This study makes two contributions to theory about the relation between discovery and change. First, I develop a framework that explicates the central role of discovery as an abductive mechanism that enables participants to reorient prevailing habits. Analyses reveal discovery to operate through what I call “abduction sequences,” or loosely connected and overlapping episodes of creative social activity. Three key motors and their attendant feelings drive discovery via abduction sequences: surprise, doubt, and inquiry. Second, I provide a methodology for use in future research on discovery. Specifically, I propose abduction sequences as a useful analytic means for examining discovery within change and other inquiry processes, such as innovation and learning, that generate fundamentally new ways of working.",ok

Using data from 3,320 CEO successions in companies listed in China’s Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 1997 to 2010, we find evidence to support this argument. We also find that the negative (positive) impact of male-to-female succession on firm performance (the likelihood of successor early departure) may be weakened by positive organizational attitudes toward female leadership as indicated by the presence of other female leaders on the firm’s board of directors and/or top management team, and the successor’s inside origin.",ok

Our research considers employees’ perception of PFP-I (perceived PFP based on individual performance) and highlights leader competence and warmth as critical contingencies. We propose that perceived PFP-I is appraised by employees as a challenge when leader competence is higher, which leads to employees’ work engagement and enhanced task performance, but is appraised as a threat when leader warmth is lower, which leads to employees’ work withdrawal and decreased task performance. In two three-wave survey studies, we found support for our model. The present research advances our knowledge regarding the incentive effect of PFP-I by emphasizing the importance of perceived PFP-I and proposing a new way of seeing employee motivation and performance ensuing from perceived PFP-I through the lenses of stress and role (dis)engagement.

Both public and private actors have attempted to promote such standards; however, we know little about the relative efficacy of such efforts. We know even less about how regional culture conditions the impact of such public and private promotion. In this study, we theorize and test how regional institutional logics filter the efficacy of public and private efforts to promote adoption of standards. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to policy, private actors such as social movement organizations, market intermediaries, and environmental entrepreneurs play a role in bolstering adoption. Yet, the efficacy of such interventions is dependent upon variations in regional culture; only environmental entrepreneurs were able to bridge the cultural divide and be equally effective in regions dominated by either market or community logics.

Alternatively, CEOs may take actions even when they have low confidence in the value of those actions, perhaps driven by self-interest or social pressures. Although research suggests that CEO option exercises following an acquisition announcement are an ex post behavioral outcome of low CEO confidence in the acquisition’s value-creation potential, prior research has not identified any ex ante signals shareholders can look for to assess acquiring CEOs’ confidence when the acquisition is announced. We address this concern by exploring a potential early warning signal of low CEO confidence: impression offsetting. We theorize that impression offsetting—measured as other unrelated positive announcements made by the firm in the days immediately surrounding the acquisition announcement—may serve as an ex ante signal of low CEO confidence in the acquisition’s value-creation potential, and, as such, will be positively associated with CEO option exercises, an ex post behavioral outcome of low confidence.

We integrate theorizing about the motivational role of need fulfillment and work/nonwork behaviors in order to examine whether two actions in particular—job crafting and leisure activity—can potentially mitigate the negative effects of value incongruence on employee performance. The results from our field study of employees from diverse organizations and industries suggest that both job crafting and leisure activity do indeed act as a buffer, mitigating the otherwise negative effects of value incongruence on employee engagement and job performance (with regard to both task performance and citizenship behavior).",ok

In an experimental study, we show that relative to non-decision-making roles, decision-making roles inculcate an economic mindset and so lead to downgrading otherwise creative ideas with cues of low social approval. A quasi-experimental study triangulates and extends this finding showing that organizational decision-making roles can habitually evoke an economic mindset that shapes creativity assessments.

To test our theory, we examine every relationship between entrepreneurial firms and their venture capital investors in the minimally invasive surgical device segment of the medical device industry over a 22-year period.

Drawing on an inductive, longitudinal, and comparative study of three new ventures within the much-hyped nascent market of impact investing, we develop an emergent theory of hype management, illustrating the field organizing practices that give rise to different forms of social proof, thereby allowing new ventures sufficient flexibility to convert hype into a sustained entrepreneurial opportunity.

When entrepreneurs set out to validate their ideas, doubt is typically framed in one of two ways: as corrosive or as generative. In both perspectives, the focus is on idea-related doubts, overlooking the possibility that once entrepreneurial action commences, self-related doubts about one’s abilities or motivation may resurface. Furthermore, while the generative approach provides valuable insights into how entrepreneurs can engage with idea doubts, it tells us little about why some individuals can do so while others may not. To address these questions, we followed early-stage entrepreneurs weekly during an incubation program. We found that they experienced not only idea-related but also self-related doubts. Their responses to these doubts—namely embracing, downplaying, or normalizing them—shaped their ability to make progress toward their goal and influenced their commitment to it.

These native English-speaking employees believed that the mandate elevated their worth in the organization, a status gain they attributed to chance, hence deeming it unearned. They also reported a heightened sense of belonging, optimism about career advancement, and access to expanded networks. Yet, among those who interacted regularly with Japanese counterparts, narratives also revealed discomfort, which was manifested in at least two ways. These informants engaged in “status rationalization,” emphasizing the benefits that Japanese employees might obtain by learning English, and prevaricated on whether the change was temporary or durable, a process we call “status stability appraisal.” The fact that these narratives were present only among those working closely with Japanese employees highlights intergroup contact as a factor in shaping the unearned status gain experience. Supplemental analysis of data gathered from 66 Japanese employees of the organization provided the broader organizational context and the nonnative speakers’ perspective of the language shift.

We test our hypotheses in three studies: a field survey, a preregistered analysis of an archival dataset, and a preregistered experiment. This work provides evidence that the internal self-views long associated with those from lower social class backgrounds may not adequately describe the upwardly mobile. Contrary to having a persistent low sense of their abilities, we find that the upwardly mobile espouse high efficacy and do speak up but that managers appear less likely to provide them with equal opportunities for voice, instead seeking it from employees from more elite backgrounds.

We find that boycotts provoke a significant increase in turnover at targeted firms, and that directors are especially likely to leave after boycotts that signal that the firm’s social values conflict with their personal values. Specifically, we find that an ideological match between a board member and the activist challengers predicts exit: liberals are more likely to leave after liberal challenges and conservatives are more likely to leave after conservative challenges. Moreover, we show that turnover is consistent with the rigidity of the right hypothesis in political psychology: conservatives, as compared to liberals, are more prone to entrenchment when their firms face challenges from the opposition. Our study offers strong evidence that corporate social performance matters to corporate directors, and provides insights into the manner in which contentious crises affect the motivation of corporate insiders.",ok

No longer can employees reliably predict when and where their coworkers will work, transforming the very ways in which coworker relationships unfold over time. This is perhaps especially true for coworker multiplex relationships, which fuse a coworker relationship with a friendship relationship and strongly affect job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Through a qualitative study of a Fortune 500 technology firm with a largely remote workforce, we build theory on how virtual coworkers form friendships with each other on the path to multiplexity. Our emergent theory reveals the centrality of “relational cadence”—perceived convergence in the patterns of interaction between oneself and a particular coworker—to the establishment and growth of these relationships. It also differentiates work-related from friendship-related cadence, stresses the symbiosis of these cadences in multiplexity, and emphasizes the importance of temporal rhythm and understanding relational particulars (the nature of the specific coworker relationship) in the development of each form of cadence. These findings highlight how virtualization affects the experience of relating at work, and thereby make important contributions to literatures on relationships at work, coworker friendships, and virtual relationships.",ok

We advance pliable guidance as a theoretical umbrella to describe how feedback seekers and providers in creative work find a balance between the direction that makes feedback informative and the freedom to explore that infuses new ideas in their work. Our findings show that more curious individuals seek feedback by asking more open questions, which allows them to obtain more feedback. We also find that ambivalent feedback is more likely to lead to feedback acceptance and design revision. Finally, our results suggest that curiosity is an important moderator of how creative workers respond to ambivalent feedback.

This literature, as well as the broader firm reputation literature, has tended to assume that individuals leading such firms find it relatively easy to accurately assess potential partner quality as reflected in their track record of past performance and behavior. Yet this prior work has largely focused on information-rich environments where potential partners are generally large and receive substantial public attention, and with whom evaluators may have high familiarity. In contrast, we draw on bounded rationality to theorize about how in information-sparse environments, individuals may misperceive the quality indicated by a firm’s objective track record. We argue that accurate evaluations depend not only on individuals’ motivation and ability to access information but on the convergence of these factors with attributes of the potential partner being evaluated. We test and find support for our framework using a novel dataset of 1,278 ratings of the quality of 153 early-stage venture capital firms by entrepreneurs that approached these firms for investments. Overall, this paper extends understanding of firm reputation dynamics to information-sparse contexts, and explores why individuals such as entrepreneurs may at times have difficulty accurately evaluating partners.",ok

Our primary argument is that CSR will be most effective at reducing turnover that is motivated by a preference for more meaningfulness at work. We find empirical support for this idea using microdata on attorneys employed by large law firms. We find that firms with higher levels of CSR have moderately lower rates of turnover to startup law firms and turnover through occupation changes, moves which are more likely to be motivated by a preference for meaningfulness than moves to nonstartup law firms. Strikingly, the retention benefits of CSR are much stronger after attorneys experience mortality-related shocks that likely cause them to reevaluate their jobs (i.e., for New York City-born attorneys following the 9/11 terror attacks). To our surprise, we also find that firms with higher levels of CSR experience higher turnover rates to nonstartup law firms. In addition to our arguments about the importance of meaningfulness, the study provides two important extensions to work examining CSR and turnover: (1) it may be useful to view the CSR-turnover relationship through a risk-management lens, and (2) investments in CSR may increase employee departures from organizations under certain conditions.",ok

We argue that the manifestation and influence of the countervailing forces (i.e., synchronization and complacency) on the STTS experience—team effectiveness relationship will depend on salient task characteristics (i.e., frequency and difficulty). More specifically, frequently performed tasks create conditions for complacency to manifest (generating an inverted-U shaped relationship between STTS experience—team efficiency), whereas infrequently performed tasks do not (generating a positive, linear relationship). We further this distinction by layering on task difficulty that, we posit, acts to amplify the respective negative and positive consequences.

Guided by an integrated review of the religion literature, we specify three dimensions of gender differentiation—social domains, sexuality, and agency—that explain why religiosity widens the gender wage gap. A series of studies tested our theoretical model. Two studies showcased the predictive power of religiosity on the gender wage gap across 140 countries worldwide and the 50 United States via gender-differentiated social domains, sexuality, and agency, explaining 37% of the variance in the wage gap. U.S. longitudinal data indicated that the gender wage gap is narrowing significantly faster in secular states. Moreover, experiments allowed for causal inference, revealing that gender-egalitarian interventions blocked the effect of religiosity on the gender wage gap.

To capture the underlying mechanism of the power–exit relationship, we conducted two experiments in which we randomly assigned decision makers to either a high- or low-power condition. We find that decision makers in the low-power condition are more likely to use a full exit via IPO than those in the high-power condition, and that frustration mediates this relationship. However, founders can also engage in partial exits, including a managerial partial exit in which the founder leaves management but keeps ownership, and a financial partial exit in which the founder divests ownership but remains in management. We find that the negative relationship between founder power and exit is more negative for full exits than for partial exits.

We also contribute to the job security and merger and acquisition literature by examining how job security and post-merger performance vary based on the paired social identity of owners. In addition to identity similarity, the type of identity also matters in mergers. We argue that family owner social identity similarity fosters greater integration between merging parties while allowing family owner pairs to retain some autonomy through their employees, thereby maximizing post-merger performance. Our data on private Swedish firms, complemented by 11 qualitative interviews across five countries and three continents, confirm that family mergers outperform other merger combinations via job security. In a supplementary critical experiment examining industry dissimilarity, we compare the socioemotional wealth perspective—which emphasizes loss aversion and predicts family firms’ unrelated diversification avoidance—to social identity theory.

While all individuals in our study entered animal shelter work with similar passion and purpose, and faced similar kinds of challenges, those on different paths interpreted challenges differently, had different emotional responses to them, engaged in different kinds of enacted sensemaking, and developed different accounts of themselves and their guiding purpose, through which they interpreted subsequent challenges.

We identify two manifestations of work–home enrichment: (1) through objective indicators of how employees allocate their time at home, and (2) through employees’ perceptual reflections of their work–home enrichment. In terms of objective indicators, our results indicate that employees transfer these resources by spending more time in resource-draining activities such as caring for family, and less time in resource-replenishing activities such as socializing and relaxing. This suggests that occupational interactional requirements facilitate a reallocation of time in the home domain. In terms of perceptual reflections, we observe that occupational interactional requirements spark employees’ vitality, which, in turn, enriches their life at home. Our results attest to considering workplace interactions as resource-replenishing features of jobs that provide benefits across the work–home interface.",ok

However, some firms choose to continue their relationship with the crisis-struck firm. We consider what makes those firms resist the temptation to respond rigidly and abandon the crisis-struck firm. We contend that firms that defy such indirect threats do so as a result of threat-defiant learning, which stems from confidence gained from their prior relational experiences. We test this concept in the context of venture capital firms’ (VCs) investments after venture crises in the form of venture involvement in a lawsuit. Studying 435 VCs’ decisions on whether to continue to invest in 105 ventures experiencing lawsuits, we find support for threat-defiant learning.

We draw from two tenets of social information processing theory to propose that negative contact with beneficiaries has a dual effect on employees. Whereas negative contact may make employees perceive low social worth, it may simultaneously lead employees to believe they are engaging in self-sacrifice for a worthy cause—a relatively positive justification of such experiences. We investigated these ideas in three studies. In Study 1, a three-wave survey of registered nurses and their supervisors supported the hypothesized dual effect. Further consistent with our theorizing, the effect of perceived self-sacrifice on job satisfaction and performance was contingent on coworker emotional support: with higher support, perceived self-sacrifice exhibited a null relationship with satisfaction and a positive relationship with performance; with lower support, these effects were negative. In Study 2, we again studied nurses using an experimental vignette method, showing that negative contact exhibits a causal effect on employee perceptions, and that negative contact is more likely to lead to perceived self-sacrifice when the contact is attributed to the nature of the work versus one’s own performance. In Study 3, a two-wave survey of people from various occupations replicated the effects of negative contact on perceived social worth and perceived self-sacrifice. Moreover, the effect of negative contact on sacrifice was contingent on affective commitment to beneficiaries.",ok

We draw on expectancy violation theory (EVT) and bring in the notion of heuristics and future-oriented expectations to examine this question, using a sample of investor reactions to earnings surprises from 2013 to 2019. We find that, in addition to comparing earnings to consensus earnings estimates, investors appear to compare the earnings surprises to the firm’s past performance and to its peers. Importantly, their expectations regarding future interactions with the firm appear to shape their decisions and generate anticipatory reactions despite a lack of full certainty about the future—a point notably absent from the EVT literature so far, which has tended to be reactive. Numerous robustness checks and post hoc analyses indicate that this behavior is driven not necessarily by unsophisticated investors, as initially predicted, but seemingly by institutional investors who rely on these multiple expectations, even though that may not be entirely rational. Our theorizing and findings make several contributions to the EVT literature, and offer practical insights for managers and investors.",ok

We pivot from this predominant focus to a focus on the detriments of transformational leader behaviors for leaders themselves. Drawing from conservation of resources theory, we propose that although transformational leader behaviors produce gains for both leaders and followers, those behaviors also trigger losses for leaders themselves. The results of two experience-sampling studies, whereby leaders and their followers completed weekly surveys for six weeks, revealed that transformational leader behaviors were associated with increases in leader emotional exhaustion and subsequent leader turnover intentions, and these detrimental consequences occurred over and above benefits to followers (Study 1) and benefits to leaders themselves (Study 2). Furthermore, the extent to which transformational leader behaviors were associated with increases in emotional exhaustion depended upon attributes of followers, such that leaders experienced greater increases in emotional exhaustion when their transformational leader behaviors were directed toward followers low in conscientiousness (Study 1) and competence (Study 2). Overall, our work provides answers to both why and under what conditions the dark side of transformational leader behaviors is likely to appear.",ok

Four experiments showed that individuals with a creative identity reported higher psychological entitlement and engaged in more unethical behaviors. Additionally, when participants believed that their creativity was rare rather than common, they were more likely to lie for money. Moreover, manipulation of the rarity of creative identity, but not of practical identity, increased psychological entitlement and unethical acts. We tested for the mediating effect of psychological entitlement on dishonesty using both measurement of mediation and experimental causal chain approaches. We further provide evidence from organizations. Responses from a sample of supervisor–subordinate dyads demonstrated that employees reporting strong creative identities who perceived creativity as rare in their work group, rather than common, were rated as engaging in more unethical behaviors by their supervisors.

We advance and test a theoretical perspective to explain when and how practice prevalence may also generate a “weakness in numbers” effect. Specifically, to explain the diffusion of reverse mergers—a controversial practice that allows a private firm to go public by merging with a publicly listed “shell company”—we suggest that prevalence affects their diffusion in a complex way based on two divergent social influence pathways, creating (a) a direct, positive effect of practice prevalence on potential adopters, who view prevalence as evidence of the practice’s value; and (b) an indirect, negative effect mediated through third-party evaluators (i.e., investors and the media), who view prevalence as a cause for concern and skepticism. We also highlight the utility of this theoretical framework by analyzing how a decline in the status of past adopters exerts a negative effect on diffusion through both social influence pathways. Employing structural equation modeling techniques, we find support for the hypothesized relationships, and we discuss the implications of the study for future research on practice diffusion.",ok

Through a qualitative, inductive study of a consulting firm, we delimit three auxiliary routines—absorption, dissemination, and differentiation—through which people navigate between the destructiveness of organizational toxicity and the need to perform given roles and tasks. We illustrate how these routines emerged in response to role and psychological diminishment originating from senior leaders, how the routines helped manage and sometimes perpetuate diminishment, and the consequences for individuals’ personal agency and the organization as a whole. In doing so, we contribute to knowledge about coping with toxic organizational conditions and on routines as a facet of emotional capability in organizations.",ok

To assess this possibility, we draw on social exchange theory and the agency model of narcissism to investigate how team narcissism composition affects team coordination and performance. Our model was tested using game-level longitudinal data from National Basketball Association teams. Teams with higher mean and maximum levels of narcissism as well as higher narcissism members in core roles (i.e., central and influential roles) had poorer coordination and in turn performance than teams with lower levels. In addition, having higher team familiarity amplified the effects of narcissism for team mean and core role narcissism. The nature of the observed interaction, however, was surprising. Originally, we hypothesized that narcissism would lead to greater decrements in coordination as familiarity increased. Instead, we found that teams with higher mean and core role narcissism maintained the same levels of coordination over time, whereas teams with lower narcissism experienced improvements in coordination. Thus, team-level narcissism appears to prevent teams from capitalizing on normative coordination gains that occur as familiarity increases. These results underscore the importance of considering narcissism when forming teams.",ok

We empirically test HCRC theory-derived hypotheses using a sample of 448 cyclists from 17 world teams who competed in 26 races during the 2015 season of the Union Cycliste Internationale World Tour. Our results revealed that higher-level HCR stocks indirectly led to deployed HCR performance through deployed HCR alignment with situational characteristics. Furthermore, SCRs acted as a critical boundary condition for the value of aligning deployed HCRs with situational characteristics such that the alignment of deployed HCRs was only advantageous when paired with relatively high levels of SCRs. Implications for future theory building, research, and practice related to HCR deployment are discussed.",ok

Specifically, an alleged violation by a high-status organization is more likely to be labeled as misconduct when that violation is part of a multiple-actor scandal compared to when it is a standalone violation. This is because multiple-actor scandal triggers sociopolitical mechanisms that decrease the protective benefits of status and augment the potential hazards of status, making status a liability during a multiple-actor scandal. Focusing empirically on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the focal social control agent and on the SEC enforcement action as labeling of misconduct, we find that status in itself neither protects nor exposes organizations to the enforcement action, but that status increases the likelihood of the enforcement action when misconduct is part of a multiple-actor scandal.",ok

Examining this possibility, we hypothesize that mind wandering involving imaginative thoughts, also known as “daydreams,” has the potential to spur creativity. We develop a theoretical model in which we examine two facets of daydreams based on their content: problem-oriented daydreams and bizarre daydreams. In addition, we specify an antecedent condition that produces such daydreams (cognitively demanding work; Studies 1 & 2) as well as a boundary condition of the effects of daydreaming on creativity (professional identification; Study 2). Taken together, the studies reported here largely support our theoretical model. Cognitively demanding work reliably elicits both facets of daydreams. However, only problem-oriented daydreams relate to creativity directly; the relationship between bizarre daydreams and creativity is entirely dependent on professional identification. In addition, we observe negative relationships between both facets of daydreams and performance more generally when employees lack professional identification (Study 2). Our results indicate that among professionally identified individuals, daydreaming carries noteworthy benefits for creativity but can also impair performance in the absence of identification.",ok

We ask: Are investors “failure-averse” and discount a failed entrepreneur even in the presence of additional information about entrepreneurial skill? Or do they make “rational inferences” in light of the additional skill information and proceed to fund the new startup? To test whether investors are failure-averse or engage in rational inference, we use experiments in the context of equity crowdfunding.

Modeling the boundary in terms of semiotic codes of opposition, we find that the encoding of the symbolic boundary serves as a temporary settlement that conveys both the category’s elite exclusivity and its cultural consonance with broader societal beliefs, tastes, and practices. Over time, however, with industry and societal changes, tensions erupt in the balance between the needs for exclusivity and consonance, propelling a redefinition of what it means to be elite.

Through an inductive study of professional ballet dancers facing extreme performance pressure, we discovered that social cues influence whether people experience maladaptive or adaptive perfectionism. We found that organizational dehumanizing cues elicited perfectionistic concerns and increased self-destructive behaviors, leading to a vicious cycle of maladaptive perfectionism and an increased likelihood of breakdowns at work. However, rehumanizing cues precipitated a shift toward adaptive perfectionism characterized by perfectionistic strivings and self-compassionate behaviors. We also show how workers can shift back and forth between maladaptive and adaptive perfectionism cycles throughout their careers. We reveal new insights at the intersection of high performance pressure, dehumanization, and perfectionism, offering dehumanization and rehumanization as key mechanisms linking the environment and perfectionism.

Other leadership research has also assumed that leaders, especially founders, can transform their leadership influence into a legacy that will survive death and departure from the organization and continue to impact followers. However, to understand the historically embedded nature of leadership influence, it is critical to unpack how specific leaders can become group prototypes and influence followers after their departure. We address this opportunity by examining organizational ghosts—former organizational members who become the ideal prototype of an organization’s values and identity. Drawing on qualitative data from an organizational merger, our analysis reveals that admired and adored leaders with broad exposure became embodied organizational prototypes. After organizational exit, they became organizational ghosts, institutionalized by associative learning, perpetuated practices, and physical memory work. When activated—either intentionally or organically—these ghosts had “ghostly encounters” (remembered and imagined) with remaining members that safeguarded the organization, comforted organizational members, and devalued alternative value systems. We introduce the concept of organizational ghosts, explain how leaders can become ghosts, and specify remembered and imagined encounters as mechanisms through which former leaders can have enduring influence in organizations.",ok

Combining evidence from an experimental and a survey study, this paper puts forward and tests two interrelated propositions: (1) employees’ team and organizational commitment interact to influence employees’ preference for different interteam conflict handling strategies; (2) a high commitment to one entity can lead to the adoption of dysfunctional conflict handling strategies with negative outcomes for the organization unless accompanied by a high commitment to the other entity. To test these propositions, we conducted an experiment (N = 179) to assess participants’ reactions to eight reality-based conflict scenarios in which their team’s interests collided with those of other teams within the same organization. For each scenario, the conflict description was manipulated with regard to the strength of participants’ team and organizational commitment (high vs. low), resulting in an 8 × 2 × 2 factorial design. As expected, results show that high levels of commitment to one entity but not the other involve specific risks for the organization, thus supporting a dual commitment model. The results were largely borne out by a subsequent survey (N = 692), which used validated measures of commitment and conflict management to support claims for construct and external validity.",ok

To address these questions, we conducted interviews with 81 individuals sampled from diverse industries and occupations. Through their descriptions, we identified three broad responses to the experience of misfit: resolution, relief, and resignation. Within these approaches, we identified distinct strategies for responding to misfit. We present a model of how participants used these strategies, often in combination, and develop propositions regarding their effectiveness at reducing strain associated with misfit. These results expand PE fit theory by providing new insight into how individuals experience and react to misfit—portraying them as active, motivated creators of their own fit experience at work.",ok

Using data on emerging artists in the field of contemporary art from 2001 to 2010, we investigate the manner in which artists’ audience-specific reputations affect their subsequent success with two distinct audiences: museums and galleries. Our findings suggest that audience-specific reputations have systematically different effects with respect to success with museums and galleries. Our findings also illuminate the extent to which audience-specific reputations are relevant for emerging research on the contingent effects of reputation. In particular, our findings support our predictions that audiences differ from one another in terms of the extent to which other signals (specifically, status and interaction with other audiences) enhance or reduce the value of audience-specific reputations. Our study thus advances theory by providing empirical evidence for the value of incorporating audience-specific reputations into the general study of reputation.",ok

Drawing upon regulatory focus theory, we propose that the gap originates with a gender bias in the questions that investors pose to entrepreneurs. A field study conducted on question-and-answer interactions at TechCrunch Disrupt New York City during 2010 through 2016 reveals that investors tend to ask male entrepreneurs promotion-focused questions and female entrepreneurs prevention-focused questions, and that entrepreneurs tend to respond with matching regulatory focus. This distinction in the regulatory focus of investor questions and entrepreneur responses results in divergent funding outcomes for entrepreneurs whereby those asked promotion-focused questions raise significantly higher amounts of funding than those asked prevention-focused questions. We demonstrate that every additional prevention-focused question significantly hinders the entrepreneur’s ability to raise capital, fully mediating gender’s effect on funding. By experimentally testing an intervention, we find that entrepreneurs can significantly increase funding for their startups when responding to prevention-focused questions with promotion-focused answers. As we offer evidence regarding tactics that can be employed to diminish the gender disadvantage in funding outcomes, this study has practical as well as theoretical implications for entrepreneurship.",ok

Integrating creativity, expertise in knowledge work, and algorithmic design literatures, we theorize on the interplay between expertise and algorithmic design in idea generation. We suggest that the prevailing algorithmic design, focusing on information exploitation, is misaligned with the recombinant innovation processes needed for idea generation, especially for experts. We design an exploration-based modification to the prevalent exploitation-based algorithm—Google Search. We hypothesize that when using exploration-based algorithms, experts can overcome confirmation bias and generate more creative ideas through recombinant innovation. Moving beyond the individual level, experts are central to bursting “ideation bubbles”—clusters of similar ideas—thus enhancing idea diversity. We test our theory in a laboratory study and a field experiment through a global ideation challenge in sustainability launched on Freelancer.

It analyzes qualitative data on two transformation projects to implement kaizen (continuous improvement) collected from two manufacturing plants in a Chinese company. In both projects, material artifacts triggered social interaction, through which frontline employees were stimulated to focus on both performance and learning. However, in one project, the interplay of material artifacts that play multiple roles led to competing understandings of organizational objectives between managerial staff and frontline employees, which resulted in regression to the previous state where frontline employees focused exclusively on performance. In the other project, by contrast, the interplay of artifacts led to interrelating understandings of organizational objectives between these actor groups, which resulted in frontline employees’ constant acceptance of the learning–performance paradox. This paper contributes to extant literature by showing how the interplay of material artifacts that play multiple roles, such as triggering, supporting, disconnecting, and connecting, contributes to rendering paradox salient, as well as to creating organizational contexts for actors’ responses to it.",ok

Drawing on a historical case study, we trace and analyze the genesis, reinforcement, and maintenance of extreme work hours in an elite consulting firm over a period of 40 years. We find that a small shift in temporal structuring mobilized two positive feedback processes. These processes consolidated a temporal order that increasingly uncoupled from the traditional workweek. Grounded in these findings, we make two contributions. First, we challenge the orthodox view of entrainment as an ideal synchronous relation between organizations and their environments. Instead, we offer temporal uncoupling as an alternative lens. It enables us to see how both synchrony and asynchrony are potentially viable options, which coexist and sometimes coconstitute each other. Second, we shed new light on temporality as a constitutive force that underpins extreme work hours and offer a novel explanation of their persistence as a case of systemic temporal lock-in. We develop positive feedback as a mechanism that explains how small temporal shifts can become consolidated into hardly reversible temporal lock-ins.",ok

We report qualitative and quantitative data on managerial lay theories, demonstrating that secondhand accounts are seen as less credible and therefore less likely to require managerial action than firsthand accounts. However, using archival data of over two million instances of employees speaking up through companies’ internal reporting systems, we show that manager behaviors are inconsistent with lay theories—managers are more likely to substantiate secondhand than firsthand accounts. Then, through four experimental studies, we (1) illustrate that despite lay theories that secondhand accounts should be discounted, managers are more likely to find credible and take action on voice from secondhand sources compared to firsthand sources; and (2) provide evidence of mechanisms underlying these effects. In highlighting this disconnect between manager lay beliefs and their actions, we suggest important considerations for voice researchers and practical implications for managers.",ok

We reveal that designing interfaces is an endogenous and iterative process of creating and harmonizing interdependencies. In our ethnographic study of the reorganization of agile software development, actors implemented a second routine cluster, which they envisioned to work autonomously. Because the teams shared resources, however, they created interdependencies across the two routine clusters that challenged their autonomy. Our findings contribute to research on routine dynamics, interdependence, and organizations design. They do so, first, by showing how the dynamics of designing interfaces are driven by the emergent nature of interdependencies, which routine participants may endogenously harmonize through routine performances. Second, our findings detail the practices through which “interface design work” is accomplished. Although some of these practices imply transitory variations in routine performances, others change the patterning of interfaces more sustainably. Third, resources play an important role in designing interfaces because making them readily available may require their reconfiguration. Moreover, the pooled interdependencies that flow from shared resources can escalate into more complex types of interdependence.",ok

Geographic co-location creates significant risks of unintentional knowledge spillovers to rivals, while it also increases the likelihood of transactions between the partner firm and the rivals in which firm knowledge can be misappropriated. As a consequence of these risks associated with the co-location of partners and rivals, the focal firm is more likely to employ defense mechanisms when designing alliances. In particular, the focal firm will use equity structures to provide greater monitoring, control, and incentive alignment and will reduce the alliance’s scope, as well as task interdependence, to address knowledge leakage concerns.",ok

Central to these tensions is the experience of existential boredom, which plays a crucial role in shaping their responses. Peacekeepers respond to existential boredom in two ways. Some embrace boredom and follow a pathway of situational adjustment of their moral values, redefining the meaning of the idealized future, and anchoring the temporal orientation in the present reality. Others renounce boredom and follow a pathway of adherence by clinging to their moral values, maintaining the meaning of the idealized future, and anchoring the temporal orientation in the idealized future. The enactment of either a pragmatic or absolute idealized future, respectively, has important implications for the adoption of new work practices.

Identity affirmation often sparked career and family identity threat that individuals resolved through time-bending sensemaking. During times of family focus, early achievers attained a sense of dual identity affirmation by believing that they had in the past (identity residue), or would again in the future (identity projection), focus on the career role, mitigating career identity threat. During periods of career focus, they similarly projected future or remembered past family involvement to mitigate family identity threat. Early achievers also found more fleeting ways to maintain their identities in identity bursts that helped them resolve threat to their career or family identity while the other was taking precedence.

We introduce a broader relational approach and draw on high-quality connections and resourcing theories to examine how a swift SOC emerges. Utilizing rich data sources, our qualitative analyses present a swift SOC cultivated in five days in a sleepaway summer camp. We find that this swift SOC was built on brief supportive connections that were made durable by resourcing artifacts. Resourcing artifacts creates scaffolds that mobilize actors to create a web of connections, leading to an organization-wide swift SOC. We propose that a swift SOC can emerge through four intertwined resourcing artifact phases: initial resourcing, embracing resourcing, reinterpreting resourcing, and expanding resourcing. During these phases, individuals imbue artifacts with new meaning and resource artifacts for (a) dyadic connection, (b) staff coordination, and (c) membership in a subgroup and (d) an organization-wide community.

Creatives and suits are at the same organizational level in their agencies. While creatives are primarily men, suits, traditionally also men, are now primarily women. Drawing on participant observation in five different U.S. advertising agencies and over 100 interviews, we show how creatives and account practitioners use gender ordering to overcome jurisdictional conflict. These practices are grounded in enacting essentialist gender differences that transform symmetric occupational relationships into hierarchical ones by embedding the gender hierarchy. We find that, while gender ordering helps women and men in cross-occupational pairs get work done, it also reinforces women’s disadvantage, because, for women, it involves low-status and emotionally taxing scut work that it does not involve for men.",ok

Suppressors who experienced higher work–family conflict reported more health problems in strong cultures of joviality, but fewer health problems in strong cultures of companionate love. Longitudinal exploratory analyses of objective performance indicators revealed that, although units characterized by strong joviality had better response times, they were also more likely to have auto accidents and property loss than units weak in joviality, with some evidence that companionate love might attenuate risky behavior on the job.

To better understand the contingencies around organizations’ responses to regulatory uncertainty, we consider the influence of corporate structure on attentional processing. Our theory and findings suggest that because corporate structure differentiates their problem-solving and learning activities, headquarters and subsidiaries differ in attention allocation on their strategic agendas. Our results show that headquarters display lower levels of uncertainty aversion than do subsidiaries, but all organizations generally make greater shifts in attention toward alternative courses of action if they possess complementary experience and access shared experience. We test these ideas using a sample of U.S. electric utility companies attending to renewable technologies from 2000 to 2010—a market greatly affected by regulatory uncertainty. By linking models of decision making under uncertainty and learning with the attention-based view, we develop a more comprehensive understanding of the ways uncertainty influences organizational attention.",ok

We analyze the conditions under which knowledge that is useful for carrying out a key value chain activity is inherited, and explore the mechanism through which such an inheritance shapes an entrant’s strategies and, in the process, influences its performance. Evidence from the early U.S. auto industry indicates that employee spinoffs generated from incumbents that had integrated a key value chain activity were also more likely to integrate that activity than other entrants, which, we suggest, reflects the application of knowledge inheritance relative to that activity. Moreover, we find that the integration of this key activity, stimulated by knowledge inheritance, contributed to the establishment of defensible strategic positioning, thereby enhancing the survival duration of inheriting spinoffs. We thus link together the phenomena of knowledge inheritance, vertical integration, and strategic positioning to explain entrant performance.

This research expands the temporal lens of competition by examining how past outcomes (i.e., winning vs. losing streak) and future expectations (i.e., underdog vs. favorite standing) collectively influence an actor’s cognitive and affective reactions to a competition, with implications for their willingness to transgress. Studies 1 (fantasy football managers) and 2 (the English Premiere League teams) show that streaks and underdog vs. favorite standing interact to predict competitive transgressions: winning streaks increase transgressions for underdogs, and losing streaks increase transgressions for favorites. Studies 3 (public defenders) and 4 (Democrats and Republicans) experimentally manipulate streaks and standing and unpack the cognitive (i.e., outcome uncertainty) and affective (i.e., excitement for underdogs, and anxiety for favorites) mechanisms that precipitate these transgressions.

Agency theory typically prescribes the use of stock options, or other outcome-based contractual arrangements, to overcome the critical issue of information asymmetry. We theorize that this arrangement, which leaves information asymmetry in place, provides CEOs an informational advantage that can be used, via impression management techniques, to circumvent some of the intended benefits of option grants. Specifically, we argue that the period leading up to an option grant creates a scenario where CEOs are incentivized to reduce the stock price of their firm for personal gain. Our results suggest that CEOs respond to this incentive by adjusting the tenor of releases from the firm during the pregrant period, providing CEOs a substantial economic gain. We also show that underpaid CEOs and CEOs with higher discretion pursue this activity more frequently. Our findings highlight a critical challenge of agency theory: if information asymmetry remains, a motivated CEO can often circumvent the contractual arrangements intended to mitigate that very problem.

Yet these markets generate more internal rejections than matches, as not all internal applicants are hired. We develop theory to explain when rejections are more or less likely to deplete an organization’s human capital resources through voluntary turnover. Drawing on the extant intraorganizational mobility literature, we argue that variations in post-rejection turnover are shaped by the information that the market provides employees about their likelihood of future internal advancement, despite being rejected in the present. Specifically, we argue that hiring manager decisions about whom to interview and hire provide information to rejected internal candidates about their ability to meet the criteria to be hired for similar jobs in the future and the likelihood that those jobs will be filled internally. Analyzing 9,355 rejections in a single firm over a five-year period, we find that rejected employees are significantly less likely to exit when they are interviewed by the hiring manager (compared to being rejected earlier) and when they are rejected in favor of another internal candidate (compared to an external candidate).",ok

While other studies have examined how unintended consequences shape the way radical change is realized, under mandated change, actors focus on bringing about the change in ways that will be, collectively, considered to realize the intended mandate. Our study, grounded in a practice approach concerning how actions bring about radical change, identifies three different action cycles: performing action cycles, reinforcing action cycles, and reflecting action cycles. Shifts in cycles are triggered by unintended consequences that escalate into breakdowns. Cumulative cycles, arising from the escalation of unintended consequences that lead to breakdowns, are necessary for bringing about a mandated change in strategy and structure. Following breakdown, actors switch to reflecting actions in which they consider the underlying intent of the mandate and how to modify the espoused strategy and structure to bring about that intent.",ok

The stakeholder preservation perspective suggests that positive market reaction to an acquisition stems from potential new value creation by honoring implicit contracts and maintaining good relationships with target stakeholders. By contrast, the stakeholder appropriation perspective posits that positive market reaction is primarily derived through wealth transfer to acquirers by defaulting on implicit contracts with target stakeholders. Using a data set of acquisitions in the United States, we find that target corporate social responsibility is positively associated with acquirer abnormal returns upon an acquisition announcement. Moreover, stakeholder value congruence between the merging firms strengthens this positive relationship, whereas business similarity between them weakens it. These findings align with the stakeholder preservation perspective and challenge the stakeholder appropriation perspective.",ok

Indeed, in the organization we explore here, organizational practices lead employees to identify with customers, but to do so in such a way that employees become—at least in part—more like “who they served” than vice versa. Moreover, the bonds we find between employees and customers are multilayered, incorporating nonwork identities, as well as identities at different levels of inclusiveness (e.g., collective and role).

In a field study at a Korean department store, employees with the highest maximum intrinsic motivation in one task had lower average and minimum performance across their other tasks as well as more performance variance across their tasks. In a laboratory experiment in the United States, working on a highly intrinsically motivating initial task led participants to perform worse in a subsequent task if it was uninteresting, but not if it was interesting. This effect was mediated by boredom, but not by a range of other psychological processes. Across both studies, moderate intrinsic motivation in one task was associated with better performance in less interesting tasks than high intrinsic motivation, revealing a curvilinear cross-task effect of intrinsic motivation.

To answer this question, we use longitudinal data on the organization Villages for Africa that introduced “macrocredit” loans to rural Tanzanians that would enable them to establish their own village enterprises. Several years after the implementation of the idea, it collapsed. Our findings allow us to make two key contributions. First, we provide a process model of high-distance translation that shows how proponents can strategically introduce an idea across highly different contexts by “culturally detaching” it from its institutional origins, leading to the idea being “culturally assimilated” into the recipient context. However, although cultural detachment and cultural assimilation indicate the successful translation of an idea, the means of doing so can later prompt its rejection. We call this the “reactance effect” of translations across highly different contexts. Second, we showcase the role of history for translation theory more generally. History—particularly the historical relationship between the sociocultural categories of the mzungu (Swahili for “foreigner”) and the villagers—influenced the way in which the macrocredit idea could be introduced to villagers and played a key role in its subsequent rejection.",ok

This is because the intensified gender role violations due to women being entrepreneurial in tandem with being novel lead investors to impose harsher judgments that these ventures violate normative business practices. Our hypotheses receive support from results of three methodologically complementary studies, including an archival study of Shark Tank (2009–2019) coupled with preregistered online and field experiments.

In this paper, we reconcile this tension and ask: “How, when, and why do women differ from men in how they choose cofounders?” We propose that women entrepreneurs generally prioritize interpersonal attraction and de-prioritize resources because doing so aligns with their interdependent self-construal, but these relationships are mitigated when legitimacy is low, such that women entrepreneurs decrease their use of interpersonal attraction and increase their focus on resources as a means to bolster legitimacy. We find support for our framework across three studies. Our findings reconcile a key tension in the literature and highlight how interdependent self-construals enable women entrepreneurs to flexibly adjust their networking approach to cofounder selection by prioritizing interpersonal attraction when legitimacy is high and by increasing their use of resource seeking when legitimacy is low.",ok

More specifically, we develop and corroborate new theory suggesting that poverty- and gender-related stressors deplete teachers’ energy and resources, limiting relational job crafting, but that teachers’ identification with the community helps to counteract this challenge, ultimately increasing their social impact. More fundamentally, we show how job-crafting theorizing, contextualized in a poverty setting, helps to explain how social organizations, through their fieldworkers (e.g., female teachers), create social impact.",ok

A systems psychodynamic approach helped us theorize how leaders’ conscious intent to collaborate served as a cover for an unconscious effort to stave off anxiety that they could not share and process. We document the arc of defensive organizing across four cycles that begin between leaders and move across groups until the whole organization becomes mobilized to unconsciously mitigate anxiety. We theorize that a common defense mechanism informs sensemaking and motivates enactments in each cycle, coopting organizing to produce a social defense for psychological and social protection. Defensive organizing consolidates, we argue, when it can shield leaders and members of an organization from anxiety while letting them perform their roles. When it cannot, it collapses, taking the leaders with it. This study extends theory by showing how anxiety can make organizing appear sensible yet fail to be adaptive, and how social defenses evolve over time, keeping leaders’ anxiety in check and anxious leaders in charge.",ok

We depart from the existing approach, which considers the effect of gender and other factors in isolation, and propose that endorsement depends on who suggests which ideas and in what ways. Drawing upon expectancy violations theory, we argue that “positive counter-stereotypical voice”—conceptualized as an idea that signals desirable traits stereotypically associated with the opposite gender—is more likely to be endorsed compared to “positive yet stereotypical voice” (i.e., that signals desirable traits consistent with stereotypical expectations of the speaker’s gender). We argue that communal voice for men and agentic voice for women constitute positive counter-stereotypical voice, whereas agentic voice for men and communal voice for women constitute positive stereotypical voice. Then, we examine why positive counter-stereotypical voice results in positive evaluations—endorsement—by arguing that it affects attributions of competence and benevolence, albeit differently for men and for women. We test our hypotheses across three studies—one field and two experimental. Combined, we contribute to both the voice and gender literatures and shed new light on our understanding of how and why women and men get their ideas endorsed.",ok

It is less clear, however, how employee volunteering is perceived by others in the workplace. Do colleagues award volunteering “credit” (e.g., associating it with being concerned about others) or do they “stigmatize” it (e.g., associating it with being distracted from work)? Moreover, do those evaluations predict how colleagues actually treat employees who volunteer more often? Adopting a reputation perspective, we draw from theories of person perception and attribution to explore these research questions. The results of a field study reveal that colleagues gave credit to employee volunteering when they attributed it to intrinsic reasons and stigmatized employee volunteering when they attributed it to impression management reasons. Ultimately, through the awarded credits, volunteering was rewarded by supervisors (with the allocation of more resources) and coworkers (with the provision of more helping behavior) when it was attributed to intrinsic motives—a relationship that was amplified when stigmas were low and mitigated when stigmas were high. The results of a laboratory experiment further confirmed that volunteering was both credited and stigmatized, distinguishing it from citizenship behavior, which was credited but not stigmatized.",ok

Accordingly, we hypothesize that the newness, simplicity, and unscriptedness of executive verbal communication are all positively associated with investor opinion convergence. We also argue that the effect of executive communication on investor opinion convergence will be amplified when investors have a greater demand for information as would be the case for those firms with higher earnings uncertainty.

In particular, we investigate the departure of temporary workers due to the expiration of their contracts. We reconcile the contradictory predictions of collective turnover research—that any type of worker’s exit impairs organizational performance—and of contingent work research—that temporary workers’ exits improve organizational performance because they provide flexibility. We argue that the planned turnover of temporary workers has an inverted U-shaped relationship with unit performance because it combines flexibility benefits and disruption costs. We also argue that the costs of planned temporary worker turnover are moderated by the proportion and the firm-specific experience of their replacements. We test these arguments using longitudinal monthly data from a leading multinational company in the food and beverage industry, and find support for our hypotheses. The study suggests that managers hiring temporary workers should consider the cost of losing them and challenges the widespread scholarly and managerial assumption that temporary workers are disposable resources.",ok

This paper looks at the battles between entrepreneurs and market incumbents in a regulated market where various institutional actors (e.g., regulators, courts) have the power to protect the incumbents by hindering the entrepreneurs. Our comparison of one failed and one successful attempt to introduce pay TV in the U.S. reveals how entrepreneurs can first enter a regulated market without facing resistance, and then introduce a new frame to legitimize their product or service despite growing resistance from incumbents. Our framework highlights framing as a strategy and framing contests as a mechanism through which entrepreneurs and incumbents can battle to enable or disable institutional change. As part of this process, we also uncover how entrepreneurs evolve from self-serving actors with no field-level intentions to powerful groups that create a ripple effect in their environment by moving their target of influence from private to institutional actors.

We introduce a new theoretical model, the foreign experience model of creative innovations, to explain how three dimensions of executives' foreign work experiences—breadth, depth, and cultural distance—predict an organization's “creative innovations,” which we define as the extent to which final, implemented products or services are novel and useful from the standpoint of external audiences. We examined 11 years (21 seasons) of fashion collections of the world's top fashion houses and found that the foreign professional experiences of creative directors predicted the creativity ratings of their collections. The results revealed individual curvilinear effects for all three dimensions: moderate levels of breadth and cultural distance were associated with the highest levels of creative innovations, whereas depth showed a decreasing positive effect that never turned negative. A significant three-way interaction shows that depth is the most critical dimension for achieving creative innovations, with breadth and cultural distance important at low but not high levels of depth. Our results show how and why leaders' foreign professional experiences can be a critical catalyst for creativity and innovation in their organizations.",ok

Inside-out network sequencing generates valuable early feedback and support from inner-circle ties that actively engage with ill-defined, ill-structured, and uncertain ideas, and delays exposure to outer-circle ties until ideas can better withstand criticism from beyond the social circle where they emerged. We further contend that the benefits of inside-out network sequencing are amplified in environments that lack support for innovation. Using an analysis of survey data and archival innovation performance records for 301 research and development scientists and engineers in a large multinational firm, we find support for our predictions.",ok

Through an inductive study of the wind energy field in Colorado, we find that logic hybridization resulted when social movement organizations (SMOs), electric utility firms, hybrid organizations, and policy makers variously responded to incompatibility between economizing and ecologizing logics. After compromise with electric utilities and efforts to justify wind power in economic terms failed to reduce the dominance of the economizing logic, SMOs switched tactics to promote the ecologizing logic. Once SMOs succeeded in altering the balance of power in the field, hybrid organizations then emerged to legitimize a new set of frames, practices, and arrangements that integrated the previously incompatible logics. Electric utility firms and policy makers then formalized and embedded the new hybridized logic in the field. Our findings suggest that the hybridization of field-level logics is a complex process in which organizational actions and field-level conditions recursively influence each other over time. This process is critical to understanding how entrepreneurs, firms, policy makers, and SMOs each contribute to the emergence of environmentally relevant sectors.",ok

We found that institutional complexity leads decision makers to delay compliance, but usually not passively: decision makers used the time before compliance to attempt to reduce institutional complexity by neutralizing opposing pressures, challenging the coercive pressure, adapting the practice to suit opponents and their own personal beliefs, and/or waiting to see how the situation would unfold as multiple parties influenced one another. We found two factors influenced decision makers' choice of responses: (1) their interpretation of institutional complexity and (2) their personal beliefs toward the practice itself. Our findings contribute to an emerging understanding of how decision makers interpret and respond to institutional complexity, and thus complement recent studies in the institutional complexity literature.",ok

Using a sample of directors of S&P 1500 firms between 2003 and 2014, we argue and find that negative media coverage and downgrades by star equity analysts are positively related to director exit, even after controlling for firm performance, overall media visibility, and negative events such as lawsuits and financial restatements. We also find that director status intensifies the effect of negative media coverage on exit, serving as the board chair attenuates the effect of star analyst downgrades on exit, and director tenure intensifies the effects of both negative media coverage and star downgrades on exit. In post-hoc testing, we provide further evidence of director reputation maintenance by demonstrating the counterintuitive finding that negative attention from the media and star analysts also increases directors’ likelihood of joining the boards of other S&P 1500 firms.",ok

In this study, we introduce the concept of “corporate volunteering climate” in order to examine the broader, more system-level functioning of corporate volunteering in workplaces. Drawing on the sensemaking process, we theorize about how this climate develops—to what extent is it driven by company-level policies versus employee convictions for a cause? We also explore the potential influence of corporate volunteering climate for volunteers and non-volunteers, in terms of the workplace (through employee affective commitment) and the community (through employee intentions to volunteer, whether through corporate opportunities or personally). The results of a study conducted with United Way Worldwide suggest that corporate volunteering climate arises through both employee belief in the cause and corporate policies, and that these forces act as substitutes for each other. Moreover, by fostering a sense of collective pride among employees, this climate is related to affective commitment, and corporate and personal volunteering intentions.",ok

Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information. However, there is a dearth of research examining how boards overcome informational barriers to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing.

Extending the attention-based view to the demand side, we argue that major customers channel the attention of executives to the existing competitive environment, resources and capabilities, and management practices (i.e., existing-oriented attention), resulting in firms’ increased emphasis on deep search within familiar domains and limiting their search in new fields. Through an empirical examination of the patenting behavior of U.S. publicly listed firms, we show that customer concentration increases search depth and decreases search breadth via executives’ existing-oriented orientation. We also find that both performance feedback above social aspiration levels and product market competition amplify the effects of customer concentration. Our study contributes to the organizational search literature by adding a demand-side explanation. It also extends the cognition view by foregrounding the role of customers in shaping executive attention.

We build on research in cognitive science and entrepreneurship to examine the nature and influence of specific forms of speech and gesturing used by entrepreneurs when pitching. In an initial qualitative field study we identify distinct pitching strategies entrepreneurs use, involving different combinations of verbal tactics (i.e., using literal and figurative language to frame a venture) and gesture (i.e., using different types of hand gestures to emphasize parts of their pitch and convey product and venture ideas). In a subsequent experimental study, we examine the impact of these strategies on investors’ propensity to invest. We find that, although variation in the type of language used by an entrepreneur has limited effects, using gestures to depict and symbolize business ideas has strong positive effects. Our findings indicate that the skilled use of gestures by entrepreneurs helps potential investors imagine aspects of a new venture for themselves, thereby enhancing perception of its investment potential.",ok

We first provide evidence for the nature of the symbolic meanings associated with these three dimensions of work clothing in a set of within-person experimental studies. The results of a 10-day field study of employees from four organizations generally supported our predictions, showing that daily clothing aesthetics and uniqueness had effects on state self-esteem and downstream behavioral consequences. The effects of daily clothing conformity emerged under the condition of greater interaction frequency with others in the workplace.

We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers’ norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers’ home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm’s legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in high-power distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy—rather than illegitimacy—among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be.

Integrating insights from the behavioral theory of the firm and regulatory focus theory, we hypothesize that, by evoking negative emotions, exposure to violent traumatic events lowers decision-makers’ promotion focus and, in turn, reduces their propensity to undertake risky actions aimed at closing the performance–aspiration gap. We further hypothesize that this effect is amplified when decision-makers have longer tenure in the community or are geographically proximate to the site of violence. We test our framework using two complementary empirical approaches: an observational field study in the NFL and two controlled experiments. The field study analyzes 39,343 fourth-down decisions made by NFL teams between 2009 and 2018, linked to data on violent events in the surrounding communities. The experimental studies replicate the primary findings and validate the proposed regulatory focus-based mechanism. Our study extends the behavioral theory of the firm by shifting the lens from dispassionate agents reacting to impersonal forces to decision-makers whose behavior is shaped by personally meaningful community-specific shocks and their emotional consequences.",ok

Drawing from recent scholarship on social evaluation, a second account—which we call “intellectual distance”—suggests that social proximity deters recognition. We probe the influence of different articulations of social proximity (i.e., direct ties, cliquishness, and reciprocity) on recognition by studying awarding decisions within the context of the Norwegian advertising industry. Interviews with key informants as well as econometric results suggest that, while self-reproduction tends to prevail over intellectual distance, these effects coexist and their relative influence varies across levels of recognition.

But there has been little consideration of individuals’ sense of how they are viewed and defined by others—their construed image—also a key dimension of the professional self, one that is similarly compromised during such disruptive events. As a result, a widespread and theoretically rich phenomenon has received virtually no attention from scholars: construed image disruption and (re)construction. We develop a grounded model of “construed image work” based on qualitative data from former professional athletes. We find that, soon after a career-disrupting event (i.e., voluntary/involuntary retirement at a young age, in this case), individuals encounter cognitive and affective disorientation (or “drift”) that impedes their careers. Our findings reveal that systematic differences in how individuals make sense of causal forces underlying the disruptive event shape the paths they take trying to achieve a new, secure construed image and alleviate the problems of “drift.” Understanding construed image work is an important first step in acknowledging the importance of construed image for our theories regarding self-perceptions in the context of careers.

We elucidate how these resource-disadvantaged firms may begin with fueling an “identity movement” among underserved users centered around a pivotal “foothold resource.” This movement serves as their entry point into an ecosystem and enables them to build a demand-side community. They then employ “demand pull” as concrete evidence to substantiate their vision, coalesce supply-side resources, and ultimately become an orchestrator. While conventional strategy research emphasizes supply-side resources as drivers of value creation, we explore the synergy between demand-side mobilization and supply-side orchestration. Finally, we illustrate how firms lacking resources craft compelling visions in conjunction with substantive actions to engage evolving target audiences.

Because ingratiation with superiors can lead to the superiors’ positive evaluations of subordinates, CFOs who exhibit higher language style matching with CEOs will receive higher compensation and are more likely to become board members of the associated firms. In addition, the proposed relationships will be stronger when CEOs are more powerful. Yet, in the presence of high CEO–CFO language style matching, CFOs are less likely to voice different viewpoints and challenge CEOs in strategic decision processes. As a result, firms tend to undertake more mergers and acquisitions, and such mergers and acquisitions will be paid with a low percentage of cash (vs. stock) and realize lower announcement returns. Using a sample of over 2,000 U.S. firms from the period 2002–2013, we find empirical support for these predictions.",ok

We find that cross-organizational collaborations are positively related to an individual’s decision to move to a previous coauthor’s organization. Additionally, moving to an organization where an individual had a direct collaboration is positively related to postmobility performance. This suggests that prior collaboration facilitates better employer–employee matches.

A qualitative study of a child welfare agency found that members organized themselves to avoid the conscious experience of psychological distress. Distress organizing involved, first, the use of collective avoidance mechanisms that constrained the time, space, and impetus for members to experience the distress of their work; and, second, patterns of interpersonal avoidance that prevented relationships in which such experiencing could occur. The mutually reinforcing, cumulative effect of distress organizing sharply reduced members’ emotional availability to clients and coworkers, which manifested as largely dispassionate responses to others’ distress. Dispassionate responding led to emotional isolation and emotional exhaustion, with which members coped by further avoidance of others. Distress organizing thus amplified rather than ameliorated distress. Amplification processes were temporarily suspended when agency members momentarily created conditions for providing and receiving compassion. These findings contribute to theory about social contexts of psychological distress in organizations, the alleviation of such distress, and the bases of organizing processes.",ok

We refer to such task switching—an individual shifting to or from tasks designated for a particular leader position—as leadership task transitions. Our qualitative study of six MTSs responding to live-actor mass-casualty incidents revealed that leadership task transitions are a double-edged sword as they can simultaneously help manage the MTS–environment interface and harm MTS internal functioning. More specifically, leadership task transitions benefit the MTS by rapidly reallocating effort to alleviate the dominant environmental pressure at that time. However, they also harm the MTS by disrupting its internal task-based cycles. Rapidly restoring the disrupted cycles mitigates this harmful effect, but such cycle restoration is not successful when there is a high level of cycle activity or when multiple areas of the MTS are disrupted. Our findings generate new knowledge on how and why leadership task transitions impact MTSs. Implications and future directions are discussed.",ok

It finds that organizations engage in “risk translation” by translating equivocality associated with the novel risk into more familiar risks, providing them with a clearer basis and guide for action. As multiple organizations take actions to manage these translated risks, the interactive effects result in an “ecology of risks” that evolves over time, allowing for the construction of a novel risk.

In both projects, extreme novelty gave rise to concept ambiguity, a lack of shared ideas about what smart cities were, and process ambiguity, a lack of shared ideas about how smart cities should be developed. Ambiguity led actors from diverse domains to form divergent cognitive representations about smart cities. As they developed boundary objects, actors made decisions that violated some cognitive representations, while reifying others into material outcomes. Their efforts to develop the objects manifest as matter battles: high-stakes conflicts about material outcomes that, over time, set the stage for collaboration failure. In advancing these ideas, I provide an alternative perspective to the literature on collaboration across boundaries, which has primarily treated boundary objects as tools of integration rather than weapons of division.",ok

We argue that negative media reactions to the announcement of a major acquisition will shape the degree to which the firm will engage in subsequent acquisition activity. However, our theory suggests that an important individual attribute, CEO temporal focus, will influence how sensitive CEOs are to media coverage. Using a sample of 747 large acquisitions made between 2006 and 2011, we find strong support for our hypotheses.

We, therefore, adopt a paradox lens to explain the dynamics through which different actors within these systems navigate the contradictions that are generated. Drawing on a global qualitative study of multi-country risk pools that provide rapid capital in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, we advance paradox theory by showing how organizational actors’ interactions (a) maintain equilibrium by generating mutually reinforcing balance among paradoxes, while (b) the clustering of poles from different paradoxes generates disequilibrium, and (c) the reknotting of poles from different paradoxes restores equilibrium.

We further show how the convergence of the exploration tendency becomes stronger under firm-specific uncertainty but weaker when the exploration patterns exhibited by the firm’s partners and competitors are incoherent. Finally, counter to expectations, we show that this convergence is weakened by the technological proximity of the firm’s competitors. Our findings inform research on vicarious learning and the antecedents of exploration by underscoring the role of interdependence in firms’ exploration tendencies.",ok

In this study, we depart from this traditional focus on between-role incongruity and explore an alternative source of role incongruity by examining how language can trigger the within-role incongruity of function-based expectations. Through an analysis of conference call transcripts and contracts for 7,649 deals during 2003–2018, we show that the incongruity of function-based expectations manifested through the language of the CFO leads banks to employ more debt contract covenants. This takes place because such incongruity increases banks’ perceived hazards. In addition, by investigating the moderating effects of corresponding CEO language and media sentiment, we show how the social context and sentiment toward the firm weaken this incongruity effect. We discuss the theoretical implications of our study for future research on the sources of role incongruity and the antecedents of contract design.",ok
